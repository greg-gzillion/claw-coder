# Foreword

The Rust programming language has come a long way in a few short years, from
its creation and incubation by a small and nascent community of enthusiasts,
to becoming one of the most loved and in-demand programming languages in the
world. Looking back, it was inevitable that the power and promise of Rust
would turn heads and gain a foothold in systems programming. What was not
inevitable was the global growth in interest and innovation that permeated
through open source communities and catalyzed wide-scale adoption across
industries.

At this point in time, it is easy to point to the wonderful features that Rust
has to offer to explain this explosion in interest and adoption. Who doesn’t
want memory safety, _and_ fast performance, _and_ a friendly compiler, _and_
great tooling, among a host of other wonderful features? The Rust language you
see today combines years of research in systems programming with the practical
wisdom of a vibrant and passionate community. This language was designed with
purpose and crafted with care, offering developers a tool that makes it easier
to write safe, fast, and reliable code.

But what makes Rust truly special is its roots in empowering you, the user, to
achieve your goals. This is a language that wants you to succeed, and the
principle of empowerment runs through the core of the community that builds,
maintains, and advocates for this language. Since the previous edition of this
definitive text, Rust has further developed into a truly global and trusted
language. The Rust Project is now robustly supported by the Rust Foundation,
which also invests in key initiatives to ensure that Rust is secure, stable,
and sustainable.

This edition of _The Rust Programming Language_ is a comprehensive update,
reflecting the language’s evolution over the years and providing valuable new
information. But it is not just a guide to syntax and libraries—it’s an
invitation to join a community that values quality, performance, and
thoughtful design. Whether you’re a seasoned developer looking to explore Rust
for the first time or an experienced Rustacean looking to refine your skills,
this edition offers something for everyone.

The Rust journey has been one of collaboration, learning, and iteration. The
growth of the language and its ecosystem is a direct reflection of the
vibrant, diverse community behind it. The contributions of thousands of
developers, from core language designers to casual contributors, are what make
Rust such a unique and powerful tool. By picking up this book, you’re not just
learning a new programming language—you’re joining a movement to make software
better, safer, and more enjoyable to work with.

Welcome to the Rust community!

  * Bec Rumbul, Executive Director of the Rust Foundation

# Introduction

Note: This edition of the book is the same as [The Rust Programming
Language](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-3rd-edition)
available in print and ebook format from [No Starch
Press](https://nostarch.com/).

Welcome to _The Rust Programming Language_ , an introductory book about Rust.
The Rust programming language helps you write faster, more reliable software.
High-level ergonomics and low-level control are often at odds in programming
language design; Rust challenges that conflict. Through balancing powerful
technical capacity and a great developer experience, Rust gives you the option
to control low-level details (such as memory usage) without all the hassle
traditionally associated with such control.

## Who Rust Is For

Rust is ideal for many people for a variety of reasons. Let’s look at a few of
the most important groups.

### Teams of Developers

Rust is proving to be a productive tool for collaborating among large teams of
developers with varying levels of systems programming knowledge. Low-level
code is prone to various subtle bugs, which in most other languages can only
be caught through extensive testing and careful code review by experienced
developers. In Rust, the compiler plays a gatekeeper role by refusing to
compile code with these elusive bugs, including concurrency bugs. By working
alongside the compiler, the team can spend its time focusing on the program’s
logic rather than chasing down bugs.

Rust also brings contemporary developer tools to the systems programming
world:

  * Cargo, the included dependency manager and build tool, makes adding, compiling, and managing dependencies painless and consistent across the Rust ecosystem.
  * The `rustfmt` formatting tool ensures a consistent coding style across developers.
  * The Rust Language Server powers integrated development environment (IDE) integration for code completion and inline error messages.

By using these and other tools in the Rust ecosystem, developers can be
productive while writing systems-level code.

### Students

Rust is for students and those who are interested in learning about systems
concepts. Using Rust, many people have learned about topics like operating
systems development. The community is very welcoming and happy to answer
students’ questions. Through efforts such as this book, the Rust teams want to
make systems concepts more accessible to more people, especially those new to
programming.

### Companies

Hundreds of companies, large and small, use Rust in production for a variety
of tasks, including command line tools, web services, DevOps tooling, embedded
devices, audio and video analysis and transcoding, cryptocurrencies,
bioinformatics, search engines, Internet of Things applications, machine
learning, and even major parts of the Firefox web browser.

### Open Source Developers

Rust is for people who want to build the Rust programming language, community,
developer tools, and libraries. We’d love to have you contribute to the Rust
language.

### People Who Value Speed and Stability

Rust is for people who crave speed and stability in a language. By speed, we
mean both how quickly Rust code can run and the speed at which Rust lets you
write programs. The Rust compiler’s checks ensure stability through feature
additions and refactoring. This is in contrast to the brittle legacy code in
languages without these checks, which developers are often afraid to modify.
By striving for zero-cost abstractions—higher-level features that compile to
lower-level code as fast as code written manually—Rust endeavors to make safe
code be fast code as well.

The Rust language hopes to support many other users as well; those mentioned
here are merely some of the biggest stakeholders. Overall, Rust’s greatest
ambition is to eliminate the trade-offs that programmers have accepted for
decades by providing safety _and_ productivity, speed _and_ ergonomics. Give
Rust a try, and see if its choices work for you.

## Who This Book Is For

This book assumes that you’ve written code in another programming language,
but it doesn’t make any assumptions about which one. We’ve tried to make the
material broadly accessible to those from a wide variety of programming
backgrounds. We don’t spend a lot of time talking about what programming _is_
or how to think about it. If you’re entirely new to programming, you would be
better served by reading a book that specifically provides an introduction to
programming.

## How to Use This Book

In general, this book assumes that you’re reading it in sequence from front to
back. Later chapters build on concepts in earlier chapters, and earlier
chapters might not delve into details on a particular topic but will revisit
the topic in a later chapter.

You’ll find two kinds of chapters in this book: concept chapters and project
chapters. In concept chapters, you’ll learn about an aspect of Rust. In
project chapters, we’ll build small programs together, applying what you’ve
learned so far. Chapter 2, Chapter 12, and Chapter 21 are project chapters;
the rest are concept chapters.

**Chapter 1** explains how to install Rust, how to write a “Hello, world!”
program, and how to use Cargo, Rust’s package manager and build tool.
**Chapter 2** is a hands-on introduction to writing a program in Rust, having
you build up a number-guessing game. Here, we cover concepts at a high level,
and later chapters will provide additional detail. If you want to get your
hands dirty right away, Chapter 2 is the place for that. If you’re a
particularly meticulous learner who prefers to learn every detail before
moving on to the next, you might want to skip Chapter 2 and go straight to
**Chapter 3** , which covers Rust features that are similar to those of other
programming languages; then, you can return to Chapter 2 when you’d like to
work on a project applying the details you’ve learned.

In **Chapter 4** , you’ll learn about Rust’s ownership system. **Chapter 5**
discusses structs and methods. **Chapter 6** covers enums, `match`
expressions, and the `if let` and `let...else` control flow constructs. You’ll
use structs and enums to make custom types.

In **Chapter 7** , you’ll learn about Rust’s module system and about privacy
rules for organizing your code and its public application programming
interface (API). **Chapter 8** discusses some common collection data
structures that the standard library provides: vectors, strings, and hash
maps. **Chapter 9** explores Rust’s error-handling philosophy and techniques.

**Chapter 10** digs into generics, traits, and lifetimes, which give you the
power to define code that applies to multiple types. **Chapter 11** is all
about testing, which even with Rust’s safety guarantees is necessary to ensure
that your program’s logic is correct. In **Chapter 12** , we’ll build our own
implementation of a subset of functionality from the `grep` command line tool
that searches for text within files. For this, we’ll use many of the concepts
we discussed in the previous chapters.

**Chapter 13** explores closures and iterators: features of Rust that come
from functional programming languages. In **Chapter 14** , we’ll examine Cargo
in more depth and talk about best practices for sharing your libraries with
others. **Chapter 15** discusses smart pointers that the standard library
provides and the traits that enable their functionality.

In **Chapter 16** , we’ll walk through different models of concurrent
programming and talk about how Rust helps you program in multiple threads
fearlessly. In **Chapter 17** , we build on that by exploring Rust’s async and
await syntax, along with tasks, futures, and streams, and the lightweight
concurrency model they enable.

**Chapter 18** looks at how Rust idioms compare to object-oriented programming
principles you might be familiar with. **Chapter 19** is a reference on
patterns and pattern matching, which are powerful ways of expressing ideas
throughout Rust programs. **Chapter 20** contains a smorgasbord of advanced
topics of interest, including unsafe Rust, macros, and more about lifetimes,
traits, types, functions, and closures.

In **Chapter 21** , we’ll complete a project in which we’ll implement a low-
level multithreaded web server!

Finally, some appendixes contain useful information about the language in a
more reference-like format. **Appendix A** covers Rust’s keywords, **Appendix
B** covers Rust’s operators and symbols, **Appendix C** covers derivable
traits provided by the standard library, **Appendix D** covers some useful
development tools, and **Appendix E** explains Rust editions. In **Appendix
F** , you can find translations of the book, and in **Appendix G** we’ll cover
how Rust is made and what nightly Rust is.

There is no wrong way to read this book: If you want to skip ahead, go for it!
You might have to jump back to earlier chapters if you experience any
confusion. But do whatever works for you.

An important part of the process of learning Rust is learning how to read the
error messages the compiler displays: These will guide you toward working
code. As such, we’ll provide many examples that don’t compile along with the
error message the compiler will show you in each situation. Know that if you
enter and run a random example, it may not compile! Make sure you read the
surrounding text to see whether the example you’re trying to run is meant to
error. In most situations, we’ll lead you to the correct version of any code
that doesn’t compile. Ferris will also help you distinguish code that isn’t
meant to work:

Ferris| Meaning  
---|---  
![Ferris with a question mark](img/ferris/does_not_compile.svg)| This code
does not compile!  
![Ferris throwing up their hands](img/ferris/panics.svg)| This code panics!  
![Ferris with one claw up, shrugging](img/ferris/not_desired_behavior.svg)|
This code does not produce the desired behavior.  
  
In most situations, we’ll lead you to the correct version of any code that
doesn’t compile.

# Getting Started

Let’s start your Rust journey! There’s a lot to learn, but every journey
starts somewhere. In this chapter, we’ll discuss:

  * Installing Rust on Linux, macOS, and Windows
  * Writing a program that prints `Hello, world!`
  * Using `cargo`, Rust’s package manager and build system

# Installation

## Installation

The first step is to install Rust. We’ll download Rust through `rustup`, a
command line tool for managing Rust versions and associated tools. You’ll need
an internet connection for the download.

Note: If you prefer not to use `rustup` for some reason, please see the [Other
Rust Installation Methods page](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-
installation-methods.html) for more options.

The following steps install the latest stable version of the Rust compiler.
Rust’s stability guarantees ensure that all the examples in the book that
compile will continue to compile with newer Rust versions. The output might
differ slightly between versions because Rust often improves error messages
and warnings. In other words, any newer, stable version of Rust you install
using these steps should work as expected with the content of this book.

### Command Line Notation

In this chapter and throughout the book, we’ll show some commands used in the
terminal. Lines that you should enter in a terminal all start with `$`. You
don’t need to type the `$` character; it’s the command line prompt shown to
indicate the start of each command. Lines that don’t start with `$` typically
show the output of the previous command. Additionally, PowerShell-specific
examples will use `>` rather than `$`.

### Installing `rustup` on Linux or macOS

If you’re using Linux or macOS, open a terminal and enter the following
command:

    
    
    $ curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
    

The command downloads a script and starts the installation of the `rustup`
tool, which installs the latest stable version of Rust. You might be prompted
for your password. If the install is successful, the following line will
appear:

    
    
    Rust is installed now. Great!
    

You will also need a _linker_ , which is a program that Rust uses to join its
compiled outputs into one file. It is likely you already have one. If you get
linker errors, you should install a C compiler, which will typically include a
linker. A C compiler is also useful because some common Rust packages depend
on C code and will need a C compiler.

On macOS, you can get a C compiler by running:

    
    
    $ xcode-select --install
    

Linux users should generally install GCC or Clang, according to their
distribution’s documentation. For example, if you use Ubuntu, you can install
the `build-essential` package.

### Installing `rustup` on Windows

On Windows, go to <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install> and follow the
instructions for installing Rust. At some point in the installation, you’ll be
prompted to install Visual Studio. This provides a linker and the native
libraries needed to compile programs. If you need more help with this step,
see <https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/installation/windows-msvc.html>.

The rest of this book uses commands that work in both _cmd.exe_ and
PowerShell. If there are specific differences, we’ll explain which to use.

### Troubleshooting

To check whether you have Rust installed correctly, open a shell and enter
this line:

    
    
    $ rustc --version
    

You should see the version number, commit hash, and commit date for the latest
stable version that has been released, in the following format:

    
    
    rustc x.y.z (abcabcabc yyyy-mm-dd)
    

If you see this information, you have installed Rust successfully! If you
don’t see this information, check that Rust is in your `%PATH%` system
variable as follows.

In Windows CMD, use:

    
    
    > echo %PATH%
    

In PowerShell, use:

    
    
    > echo $env:Path
    

In Linux and macOS, use:

    
    
    $ echo $PATH
    

If that’s all correct and Rust still isn’t working, there are a number of
places you can get help. Find out how to get in touch with other Rustaceans (a
silly nickname we call ourselves) on [the community page](https://www.rust-
lang.org/community).

### Updating and Uninstalling

Once Rust is installed via `rustup`, updating to a newly released version is
easy. From your shell, run the following update script:

    
    
    $ rustup update
    

To uninstall Rust and `rustup`, run the following uninstall script from your
shell:

    
    
    $ rustup self uninstall
    

### Reading the Local Documentation

The installation of Rust also includes a local copy of the documentation so
that you can read it offline. Run `rustup doc` to open the local documentation
in your browser.

Any time a type or function is provided by the standard library and you’re not
sure what it does or how to use it, use the application programming interface
(API) documentation to find out!

### Using Text Editors and IDEs

This book makes no assumptions about what tools you use to author Rust code.
Just about any text editor will get the job done! However, many text editors
and integrated development environments (IDEs) have built-in support for Rust.
You can always find a fairly current list of many editors and IDEs on [the
tools page](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools) on the Rust website.

### Working Offline with This Book

In several examples, we will use Rust packages beyond the standard library. To
work through those examples, you will either need to have an internet
connection or to have downloaded those dependencies ahead of time. To download
the dependencies ahead of time, you can run the following commands. (We’ll
explain what `cargo` is and what each of these commands does in detail later.)

    
    
    $ cargo new get-dependencies
    $ cd get-dependencies
    $ cargo add rand@0.8.5 trpl@0.2.0
    

This will cache the downloads for these packages so you will not need to
download them later. Once you have run this command, you do not need to keep
the `get-dependencies` folder. If you have run this command, you can use the
`--offline` flag with all `cargo` commands in the rest of the book to use
these cached versions instead of attempting to use the network.

# Hello, World!

## Hello, World!

Now that you’ve installed Rust, it’s time to write your first Rust program.
It’s traditional when learning a new language to write a little program that
prints the text `Hello, world!` to the screen, so we’ll do the same here!

Note: This book assumes basic familiarity with the command line. Rust makes no
specific demands about your editing or tooling or where your code lives, so if
you prefer to use an IDE instead of the command line, feel free to use your
favorite IDE. Many IDEs now have some degree of Rust support; check the IDE’s
documentation for details. The Rust team has been focusing on enabling great
IDE support via `rust-analyzer`. See Appendix D for more details.

### Project Directory Setup

You’ll start by making a directory to store your Rust code. It doesn’t matter
to Rust where your code lives, but for the exercises and projects in this
book, we suggest making a _projects_ directory in your home directory and
keeping all your projects there.

Open a terminal and enter the following commands to make a _projects_
directory and a directory for the “Hello, world!” project within the
_projects_ directory.

For Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, enter this:

    
    
    $ mkdir ~/projects
    $ cd ~/projects
    $ mkdir hello_world
    $ cd hello_world
    

For Windows CMD, enter this:

    
    
    > mkdir "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
    > cd /d "%USERPROFILE%\projects"
    > mkdir hello_world
    > cd hello_world
    

### Rust Program Basics

Next, make a new source file and call it _main.rs_. Rust files always end with
the _.rs_ extension. If you’re using more than one word in your filename, the
convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use
_hello_world.rs_ rather than _helloworld.rs_.

Now open the _main.rs_ file you just created and enter the code in Listing
1-1.

Filename: main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }

Listing 1-1: A program that prints `Hello, world!`

Save the file and go back to your terminal window in the
_~/projects/hello_world_ directory. On Linux or macOS, enter the following
commands to compile and run the file:

    
    
    $ rustc main.rs
    $ ./main
    Hello, world!
    

On Windows, enter the command `.\main` instead of `./main`:

    
    
    > rustc main.rs
    > .\main
    Hello, world!
    

Regardless of your operating system, the string `Hello, world!` should print
to the terminal. If you don’t see this output, refer back to the
“Troubleshooting” part of the Installation section for ways to get help.

If `Hello, world!` did print, congratulations! You’ve officially written a
Rust program. That makes you a Rust programmer—welcome!

### The Anatomy of a Rust Program

Let’s review this “Hello, world!” program in detail. Here’s the first piece of
the puzzle:

    
    
    fn main() {
    
    }

These lines define a function named `main`. The `main` function is special: It
is always the first code that runs in every executable Rust program. Here, the
first line declares a function named `main` that has no parameters and returns
nothing. If there were parameters, they would go inside the parentheses
(`()`).

The function body is wrapped in `{}`. Rust requires curly brackets around all
function bodies. It’s good style to place the opening curly bracket on the
same line as the function declaration, adding one space in between.

Note: If you want to stick to a standard style across Rust projects, you can
use an automatic formatter tool called `rustfmt` to format your code in a
particular style (more on `rustfmt` in Appendix D). The Rust team has included
this tool with the standard Rust distribution, as `rustc` is, so it should
already be installed on your computer!

The body of the `main` function holds the following code:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    println!("Hello, world!");
    }

This line does all the work in this little program: It prints text to the
screen. There are three important details to notice here.

First, `println!` calls a Rust macro. If it had called a function instead, it
would be entered as `println` (without the `!`). Rust macros are a way to
write code that generates code to extend Rust syntax, and we’ll discuss them
in more detail in Chapter 20. For now, you just need to know that using a `!`
means that you’re calling a macro instead of a normal function and that macros
don’t always follow the same rules as functions.

Second, you see the `"Hello, world!"` string. We pass this string as an
argument to `println!`, and the string is printed to the screen.

Third, we end the line with a semicolon (`;`), which indicates that this
expression is over, and the next one is ready to begin. Most lines of Rust
code end with a semicolon.

### Compilation and Execution

You’ve just run a newly created program, so let’s examine each step in the
process.

Before running a Rust program, you must compile it using the Rust compiler by
entering the `rustc` command and passing it the name of your source file, like
this:

    
    
    $ rustc main.rs
    

If you have a C or C++ background, you’ll notice that this is similar to `gcc`
or `clang`. After compiling successfully, Rust outputs a binary executable.

On Linux, macOS, and PowerShell on Windows, you can see the executable by
entering the `ls` command in your shell:

    
    
    $ ls
    main  main.rs
    

On Linux and macOS, you’ll see two files. With PowerShell on Windows, you’ll
see the same three files that you would see using CMD. With CMD on Windows,
you would enter the following:

    
    
    > dir /B %= the /B option says to only show the file names =%
    main.exe
    main.pdb
    main.rs
    

This shows the source code file with the _.rs_ extension, the executable file
(_main.exe_ on Windows, but _main_ on all other platforms), and, when using
Windows, a file containing debugging information with the _.pdb_ extension.
From here, you run the _main_ or _main.exe_ file, like this:

    
    
    $ ./main # or .\main on Windows
    

If your _main.rs_ is your “Hello, world!” program, this line prints `Hello,
world!` to your terminal.

If you’re more familiar with a dynamic language, such as Ruby, Python, or
JavaScript, you might not be used to compiling and running a program as
separate steps. Rust is an _ahead-of-time compiled_ language, meaning you can
compile a program and give the executable to someone else, and they can run it
even without having Rust installed. If you give someone a _.rb_ , _.py_ , or
_.js_ file, they need to have a Ruby, Python, or JavaScript implementation
installed (respectively). But in those languages, you only need one command to
compile and run your program. Everything is a trade-off in language design.

Just compiling with `rustc` is fine for simple programs, but as your project
grows, you’ll want to manage all the options and make it easy to share your
code. Next, we’ll introduce you to the Cargo tool, which will help you write
real-world Rust programs.

# Hello, Cargo!

## Hello, Cargo!

Cargo is Rust’s build system and package manager. Most Rustaceans use this
tool to manage their Rust projects because Cargo handles a lot of tasks for
you, such as building your code, downloading the libraries your code depends
on, and building those libraries. (We call the libraries that your code needs
_dependencies_.)

The simplest Rust programs, like the one we’ve written so far, don’t have any
dependencies. If we had built the “Hello, world!” project with Cargo, it would
only use the part of Cargo that handles building your code. As you write more
complex Rust programs, you’ll add dependencies, and if you start a project
using Cargo, adding dependencies will be much easier to do.

Because the vast majority of Rust projects use Cargo, the rest of this book
assumes that you’re using Cargo too. Cargo comes installed with Rust if you
used the official installers discussed in the “Installation” section. If you
installed Rust through some other means, check whether Cargo is installed by
entering the following in your terminal:

    
    
    $ cargo --version
    

If you see a version number, you have it! If you see an error, such as
`command not found`, look at the documentation for your method of installation
to determine how to install Cargo separately.

### Creating a Project with Cargo

Let’s create a new project using Cargo and look at how it differs from our
original “Hello, world!” project. Navigate back to your _projects_ directory
(or wherever you decided to store your code). Then, on any operating system,
run the following:

    
    
    $ cargo new hello_cargo
    $ cd hello_cargo
    

The first command creates a new directory and project called _hello_cargo_.
We’ve named our project _hello_cargo_ , and Cargo creates its files in a
directory of the same name.

Go into the _hello_cargo_ directory and list the files. You’ll see that Cargo
has generated two files and one directory for us: a _Cargo.toml_ file and a
_src_ directory with a _main.rs_ file inside.

It has also initialized a new Git repository along with a _.gitignore_ file.
Git files won’t be generated if you run `cargo new` within an existing Git
repository; you can override this behavior by using `cargo new --vcs=git`.

Note: Git is a common version control system. You can change `cargo new` to
use a different version control system or no version control system by using
the `--vcs` flag. Run `cargo new --help` to see the available options.

Open _Cargo.toml_ in your text editor of choice. It should look similar to the
code in Listing 1-2.

Filename: Cargo.toml

    
    
    [package]
    name = "hello_cargo"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"
    
    [dependencies]
    

Listing 1-2: Contents of _Cargo.toml_ generated by `cargo new`

This file is in the [_TOML_](https://toml.io) (_Tom’s Obvious, Minimal
Language_) format, which is Cargo’s configuration format.

The first line, `[package]`, is a section heading that indicates that the
following statements are configuring a package. As we add more information to
this file, we’ll add other sections.

The next three lines set the configuration information Cargo needs to compile
your program: the name, the version, and the edition of Rust to use. We’ll
talk about the `edition` key in Appendix E.

The last line, `[dependencies]`, is the start of a section for you to list any
of your project’s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as
_crates_. We won’t need any other crates for this project, but we will in the
first project in Chapter 2, so we’ll use this dependencies section then.

Now open _src/main.rs_ and take a look:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }

Cargo has generated a “Hello, world!” program for you, just like the one we
wrote in Listing 1-1! So far, the differences between our project and the
project Cargo generated are that Cargo placed the code in the _src_ directory,
and we have a _Cargo.toml_ configuration file in the top directory.

Cargo expects your source files to live inside the _src_ directory. The top-
level project directory is just for README files, license information,
configuration files, and anything else not related to your code. Using Cargo
helps you organize your projects. There’s a place for everything, and
everything is in its place.

If you started a project that doesn’t use Cargo, as we did with the “Hello,
world!” project, you can convert it to a project that does use Cargo. Move the
project code into the _src_ directory and create an appropriate _Cargo.toml_
file. One easy way to get that _Cargo.toml_ file is to run `cargo init`, which
will create it for you automatically.

### Building and Running a Cargo Project

Now let’s look at what’s different when we build and run the “Hello, world!”
program with Cargo! From your _hello_cargo_ directory, build your project by
entering the following command:

    
    
    $ cargo build
       Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 2.85 secs
    

This command creates an executable file in _target/debug/hello_cargo_ (or
_target\debug\hello_cargo.exe_ on Windows) rather than in your current
directory. Because the default build is a debug build, Cargo puts the binary
in a directory named _debug_. You can run the executable with this command:

    
    
    $ ./target/debug/hello_cargo # or .\target\debug\hello_cargo.exe on Windows
    Hello, world!
    

If all goes well, `Hello, world!` should print to the terminal. Running `cargo
build` for the first time also causes Cargo to create a new file at the top
level: _Cargo.lock_. This file keeps track of the exact versions of
dependencies in your project. This project doesn’t have dependencies, so the
file is a bit sparse. You won’t ever need to change this file manually; Cargo
manages its contents for you.

We just built a project with `cargo build` and ran it with
`./target/debug/hello_cargo`, but we can also use `cargo run` to compile the
code and then run the resultant executable all in one command:

    
    
    $ cargo run
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.0 secs
         Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
    Hello, world!
    

Using `cargo run` is more convenient than having to remember to run `cargo
build` and then use the whole path to the binary, so most developers use
`cargo run`.

Notice that this time we didn’t see output indicating that Cargo was compiling
`hello_cargo`. Cargo figured out that the files hadn’t changed, so it didn’t
rebuild but just ran the binary. If you had modified your source code, Cargo
would have rebuilt the project before running it, and you would have seen this
output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.33 secs
         Running `target/debug/hello_cargo`
    Hello, world!
    

Cargo also provides a command called `cargo check`. This command quickly
checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesn’t produce an executable:

    
    
    $ cargo check
       Checking hello_cargo v0.1.0 (file:///projects/hello_cargo)
        Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32 secs
    

Why would you not want an executable? Often, `cargo check` is much faster than
`cargo build` because it skips the step of producing an executable. If you’re
continually checking your work while writing the code, using `cargo check`
will speed up the process of letting you know if your project is still
compiling! As such, many Rustaceans run `cargo check` periodically as they
write their program to make sure it compiles. Then, they run `cargo build`
when they’re ready to use the executable.

Let’s recap what we’ve learned so far about Cargo:

  * We can create a project using `cargo new`.
  * We can build a project using `cargo build`.
  * We can build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`.
  * We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`.
  * Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the _target/debug_ directory.

An additional advantage of using Cargo is that the commands are the same no
matter which operating system you’re working on. So, at this point, we’ll no
longer provide specific instructions for Linux and macOS versus Windows.

### Building for Release

When your project is finally ready for release, you can use `cargo build
--release` to compile it with optimizations. This command will create an
executable in _target/release_ instead of _target/debug_. The optimizations
make your Rust code run faster, but turning them on lengthens the time it
takes for your program to compile. This is why there are two different
profiles: one for development, when you want to rebuild quickly and often, and
another for building the final program you’ll give to a user that won’t be
rebuilt repeatedly and that will run as fast as possible. If you’re
benchmarking your code’s running time, be sure to run `cargo build --release`
and benchmark with the executable in _target/release_.

### Leveraging Cargo’s Conventions

With simple projects, Cargo doesn’t provide a lot of value over just using
`rustc`, but it will prove its worth as your programs become more intricate.
Once programs grow to multiple files or need a dependency, it’s much easier to
let Cargo coordinate the build.

Even though the `hello_cargo` project is simple, it now uses much of the real
tooling you’ll use in the rest of your Rust career. In fact, to work on any
existing projects, you can use the following commands to check out the code
using Git, change to that project’s directory, and build:

    
    
    $ git clone example.org/someproject
    $ cd someproject
    $ cargo build
    

For more information about Cargo, check out [its
documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

## Summary

You’re already off to a great start on your Rust journey! In this chapter, you
learned how to:

  * Install the latest stable version of Rust using `rustup`.
  * Update to a newer Rust version.
  * Open locally installed documentation.
  * Write and run a “Hello, world!” program using `rustc` directly.
  * Create and run a new project using the conventions of Cargo.

This is a great time to build a more substantial program to get used to
reading and writing Rust code. So, in Chapter 2, we’ll build a guessing game
program. If you would rather start by learning how common programming concepts
work in Rust, see Chapter 3 and then return to Chapter 2.

# Programming a Guessing Game

Let’s jump into Rust by working through a hands-on project together! This
chapter introduces you to a few common Rust concepts by showing you how to use
them in a real program. You’ll learn about `let`, `match`, methods, associated
functions, external crates, and more! In the following chapters, we’ll explore
these ideas in more detail. In this chapter, you’ll just practice the
fundamentals.

We’ll implement a classic beginner programming problem: a guessing game.
Here’s how it works: The program will generate a random integer between 1 and
100. It will then prompt the player to enter a guess. After a guess is
entered, the program will indicate whether the guess is too low or too high.
If the guess is correct, the game will print a congratulatory message and
exit.

## Setting Up a New Project

To set up a new project, go to the _projects_ directory that you created in
Chapter 1 and make a new project using Cargo, like so:

    
    
    $ cargo new guessing_game
    $ cd guessing_game
    

The first command, `cargo new`, takes the name of the project
(`guessing_game`) as the first argument. The second command changes to the new
project’s directory.

Look at the generated _Cargo.toml_ file:

Filename: Cargo.toml

    
    
    [package]
    name = "guessing_game"
    version = "0.1.0"
    edition = "2024"
    
    [dependencies]
    

As you saw in Chapter 1, `cargo new` generates a “Hello, world!” program for
you. Check out the _src/main.rs_ file:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    }

Now let’s compile this “Hello, world!” program and run it in the same step
using the `cargo run` command:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Hello, world!
    

The `run` command comes in handy when you need to rapidly iterate on a
project, as we’ll do in this game, quickly testing each iteration before
moving on to the next one.

Reopen the _src/main.rs_ file. You’ll be writing all the code in this file.

## Processing a Guess

The first part of the guessing game program will ask for user input, process
that input, and check that the input is in the expected form. To start, we’ll
allow the player to input a guess. Enter the code in Listing 2-1 into
_src/main.rs_.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

Listing 2-1: Code that gets a guess from the user and prints it

This code contains a lot of information, so let’s go over it line by line. To
obtain user input and then print the result as output, we need to bring the
`io` input/output library into scope. The `io` library comes from the standard
library, known as `std`:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

By default, Rust has a set of items defined in the standard library that it
brings into the scope of every program. This set is called the _prelude_ , and
you can see everything in it [in the standard library
documentation](../std/prelude/index.html).

If a type you want to use isn’t in the prelude, you have to bring that type
into scope explicitly with a `use` statement. Using the `std::io` library
provides you with a number of useful features, including the ability to accept
user input.

As you saw in Chapter 1, the `main` function is the entry point into the
program:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

The `fn` syntax declares a new function; the parentheses, `()`, indicate there
are no parameters; and the curly bracket, `{`, starts the body of the
function.

As you also learned in Chapter 1, `println!` is a macro that prints a string
to the screen:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

This code is printing a prompt stating what the game is and requesting input
from the user.

### Storing Values with Variables

Next, we’ll create a _variable_ to store the user input, like this:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

Now the program is getting interesting! There’s a lot going on in this little
line. We use the `let` statement to create the variable. Here’s another
example:

    
    
    let apples = 5;

This line creates a new variable named `apples` and binds it to the value `5`.
In Rust, variables are immutable by default, meaning once we give the variable
a value, the value won’t change. We’ll be discussing this concept in detail in
the “Variables and Mutability” section in Chapter 3. To make a variable
mutable, we add `mut` before the variable name:

    
    
    let apples = 5; // immutable
    let mut bananas = 5; // mutable

Note: The `//` syntax starts a comment that continues until the end of the
line. Rust ignores everything in comments. We’ll discuss comments in more
detail in Chapter 3.

Returning to the guessing game program, you now know that `let mut guess` will
introduce a mutable variable named `guess`. The equal sign (`=`) tells Rust we
want to bind something to the variable now. On the right of the equal sign is
the value that `guess` is bound to, which is the result of calling
`String::new`, a function that returns a new instance of a `String`.
[`String`](../std/string/struct.String.html) is a string type provided by the
standard library that is a growable, UTF-8 encoded bit of text.

The `::` syntax in the `::new` line indicates that `new` is an associated
function of the `String` type. An _associated function_ is a function that’s
implemented on a type, in this case `String`. This `new` function creates a
new, empty string. You’ll find a `new` function on many types because it’s a
common name for a function that makes a new value of some kind.

In full, the `let mut guess = String::new();` line has created a mutable
variable that is currently bound to a new, empty instance of a `String`. Whew!

### Receiving User Input

Recall that we included the input/output functionality from the standard
library with `use std::io;` on the first line of the program. Now we’ll call
the `stdin` function from the `io` module, which will allow us to handle user
input:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

If we hadn’t imported the `io` module with `use std::io;` at the beginning of
the program, we could still use the function by writing this function call as
`std::io::stdin`. The `stdin` function returns an instance of
[`std::io::Stdin`](../std/io/struct.Stdin.html), which is a type that
represents a handle to the standard input for your terminal.

Next, the line `.read_line(&mut guess)` calls the
[`read_line`](../std/io/struct.Stdin.html#method.read_line) method on the
standard input handle to get input from the user. We’re also passing `&mut
guess` as the argument to `read_line` to tell it what string to store the user
input in. The full job of `read_line` is to take whatever the user types into
standard input and append that into a string (without overwriting its
contents), so we therefore pass that string as an argument. The string
argument needs to be mutable so that the method can change the string’s
content.

The `&` indicates that this argument is a _reference_ , which gives you a way
to let multiple parts of your code access one piece of data without needing to
copy that data into memory multiple times. References are a complex feature,
and one of Rust’s major advantages is how safe and easy it is to use
references. You don’t need to know a lot of those details to finish this
program. For now, all you need to know is that, like variables, references are
immutable by default. Hence, you need to write `&mut guess` rather than
`&guess` to make it mutable. (Chapter 4 will explain references more
thoroughly.)

### Handling Potential Failure with `Result`

We’re still working on this line of code. We’re now discussing a third line of
text, but note that it’s still part of a single logical line of code. The next
part is this method:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

We could have written this code as:

    
    
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess).expect("Failed to read line");

However, one long line is difficult to read, so it’s best to divide it. It’s
often wise to introduce a newline and other whitespace to help break up long
lines when you call a method with the `.method_name()` syntax. Now let’s
discuss what this line does.

As mentioned earlier, `read_line` puts whatever the user enters into the
string we pass to it, but it also returns a `Result` value.
[`Result`](../std/result/enum.Result.html) is an _enumeration_, often called
an _enum_ , which is a type that can be in one of multiple possible states. We
call each possible state a _variant_.

Chapter 6 will cover enums in more detail. The purpose of these `Result` types
is to encode error-handling information.

`Result`’s variants are `Ok` and `Err`. The `Ok` variant indicates the
operation was successful, and it contains the successfully generated value.
The `Err` variant means the operation failed, and it contains information
about how or why the operation failed.

Values of the `Result` type, like values of any type, have methods defined on
them. An instance of `Result` has an [`expect`
method](../std/result/enum.Result.html#method.expect) that you can call. If
this instance of `Result` is an `Err` value, `expect` will cause the program
to crash and display the message that you passed as an argument to `expect`.
If the `read_line` method returns an `Err`, it would likely be the result of
an error coming from the underlying operating system. If this instance of
`Result` is an `Ok` value, `expect` will take the return value that `Ok` is
holding and return just that value to you so that you can use it. In this
case, that value is the number of bytes in the user’s input.

If you don’t call `expect`, the program will compile, but you’ll get a
warning:

    
    
    $ cargo build
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
    warning: unused `Result` that must be used
      --> src/main.rs:10:5
       |
    10 |     io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
       |     ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
       |
       = note: this `Result` may be an `Err` variant, which should be handled
       = note: `#[warn(unused_must_use)]` on by default
    help: use `let _ = ...` to ignore the resulting value
       |
    10 |     let _ = io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess);
       |     +++++++
    
    warning: `guessing_game` (bin "guessing_game") generated 1 warning
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.59s
    

Rust warns that you haven’t used the `Result` value returned from `read_line`,
indicating that the program hasn’t handled a possible error.

The right way to suppress the warning is to actually write error-handling
code, but in our case we just want to crash this program when a problem
occurs, so we can use `expect`. You’ll learn about recovering from errors in
Chapter 9.

### Printing Values with `println!` Placeholders

Aside from the closing curly bracket, there’s only one more line to discuss in
the code so far:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

This line prints the string that now contains the user’s input. The `{}` set
of curly brackets is a placeholder: Think of `{}` as little crab pincers that
hold a value in place. When printing the value of a variable, the variable
name can go inside the curly brackets. When printing the result of evaluating
an expression, place empty curly brackets in the format string, then follow
the format string with a comma-separated list of expressions to print in each
empty curly bracket placeholder in the same order. Printing a variable and the
result of an expression in one call to `println!` would look like this:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    let y = 10;
    
    println!("x = {x} and y + 2 = {}", y + 2);
    }

This code would print `x = 5 and y + 2 = 12`.

### Testing the First Part

Let’s test the first part of the guessing game. Run it using `cargo run`:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 6.44s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Guess the number!
    Please input your guess.
    6
    You guessed: 6
    

At this point, the first part of the game is done: We’re getting input from
the keyboard and then printing it.

## Generating a Secret Number

Next, we need to generate a secret number that the user will try to guess. The
secret number should be different every time so that the game is fun to play
more than once. We’ll use a random number between 1 and 100 so that the game
isn’t too difficult. Rust doesn’t yet include random number functionality in
its standard library. However, the Rust team does provide a [`rand`
crate](https://crates.io/crates/rand) with said functionality.

### Increasing Functionality with a Crate

Remember that a crate is a collection of Rust source code files. The project
we’ve been building is a binary crate, which is an executable. The `rand`
crate is a library crate, which contains code that is intended to be used in
other programs and can’t be executed on its own.

Cargo’s coordination of external crates is where Cargo really shines. Before
we can write code that uses `rand`, we need to modify the _Cargo.toml_ file to
include the `rand` crate as a dependency. Open that file now and add the
following line to the bottom, beneath the `[dependencies]` section header that
Cargo created for you. Be sure to specify `rand` exactly as we have here, with
this version number, or the code examples in this tutorial may not work:

Filename: Cargo.toml

    
    
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.8.5"
    

In the _Cargo.toml_ file, everything that follows a header is part of that
section that continues until another section starts. In `[dependencies]`, you
tell Cargo which external crates your project depends on and which versions of
those crates you require. In this case, we specify the `rand` crate with the
semantic version specifier `0.8.5`. Cargo understands [Semantic
Versioning](http://semver.org) (sometimes called _SemVer_), which is a
standard for writing version numbers. The specifier `0.8.5` is actually
shorthand for `^0.8.5`, which means any version that is at least 0.8.5 but
below 0.9.0.

Cargo considers these versions to have public APIs compatible with version
0.8.5, and this specification ensures that you’ll get the latest patch release
that will still compile with the code in this chapter. Any version 0.9.0 or
greater is not guaranteed to have the same API as what the following examples
use.

Now, without changing any of the code, let’s build the project, as shown in
Listing 2-2.

    
    
    $ cargo build

Listing 2-2: The output from running `cargo build` after adding the `rand`
crate as a dependency

You may see different version numbers (but they will all be compatible with
the code, thanks to SemVer!) and different lines (depending on the operating
system), and the lines may be in a different order.

When we include an external dependency, Cargo fetches the latest versions of
everything that dependency needs from the _registry_ , which is a copy of data
from [Crates.io](https://crates.io/). Crates.io is where people in the Rust
ecosystem post their open source Rust projects for others to use.

After updating the registry, Cargo checks the `[dependencies]` section and
downloads any crates listed that aren’t already downloaded. In this case,
although we only listed `rand` as a dependency, Cargo also grabbed other
crates that `rand` depends on to work. After downloading the crates, Rust
compiles them and then compiles the project with the dependencies available.

If you immediately run `cargo build` again without making any changes, you
won’t get any output aside from the `Finished` line. Cargo knows it has
already downloaded and compiled the dependencies, and you haven’t changed
anything about them in your _Cargo.toml_ file. Cargo also knows that you
haven’t changed anything about your code, so it doesn’t recompile that either.
With nothing to do, it simply exits.

If you open the _src/main.rs_ file, make a trivial change, and then save it
and build again, you’ll only see two lines of output:

    
    
    $ cargo build
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
    

These lines show that Cargo only updates the build with your tiny change to
the _src/main.rs_ file. Your dependencies haven’t changed, so Cargo knows it
can reuse what it has already downloaded and compiled for those.

#### Ensuring Reproducible Builds

Cargo has a mechanism that ensures that you can rebuild the same artifact
every time you or anyone else builds your code: Cargo will use only the
versions of the dependencies you specified until you indicate otherwise. For
example, say that next week version 0.8.6 of the `rand` crate comes out, and
that version contains an important bug fix, but it also contains a regression
that will break your code. To handle this, Rust creates the _Cargo.lock_ file
the first time you run `cargo build`, so we now have this in the
_guessing_game_ directory.

When you build a project for the first time, Cargo figures out all the
versions of the dependencies that fit the criteria and then writes them to the
_Cargo.lock_ file. When you build your project in the future, Cargo will see
that the _Cargo.lock_ file exists and will use the versions specified there
rather than doing all the work of figuring out versions again. This lets you
have a reproducible build automatically. In other words, your project will
remain at 0.8.5 until you explicitly upgrade, thanks to the _Cargo.lock_ file.
Because the _Cargo.lock_ file is important for reproducible builds, it’s often
checked into source control with the rest of the code in your project.

#### Updating a Crate to Get a New Version

When you _do_ want to update a crate, Cargo provides the command `update`,
which will ignore the _Cargo.lock_ file and figure out all the latest versions
that fit your specifications in _Cargo.toml_. Cargo will then write those
versions to the _Cargo.lock_ file. Otherwise, by default, Cargo will only look
for versions greater than 0.8.5 and less than 0.9.0. If the `rand` crate has
released the two new versions 0.8.6 and 0.999.0, you would see the following
if you ran `cargo update`:

    
    
    $ cargo update
        Updating crates.io index
         Locking 1 package to latest Rust 1.85.0 compatible version
        Updating rand v0.8.5 -> v0.8.6 (available: v0.999.0)
    

Cargo ignores the 0.999.0 release. At this point, you would also notice a
change in your _Cargo.lock_ file noting that the version of the `rand` crate
you are now using is 0.8.6. To use `rand` version 0.999.0 or any version in
the 0.999._x_ series, you’d have to update the _Cargo.toml_ file to look like
this instead (don’t actually make this change because the following examples
assume you’re using `rand` 0.8):

    
    
    [dependencies]
    rand = "0.999.0"
    

The next time you run `cargo build`, Cargo will update the registry of crates
available and reevaluate your `rand` requirements according to the new version
you have specified.

There’s a lot more to say about [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/) and
[its ecosystem](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/publishing.html),
which we’ll discuss in Chapter 14, but for now, that’s all you need to know.
Cargo makes it very easy to reuse libraries, so Rustaceans are able to write
smaller projects that are assembled from a number of packages.

### Generating a Random Number

Let’s start using `rand` to generate a number to guess. The next step is to
update _src/main.rs_ , as shown in Listing 2-3.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

Listing 2-3: Adding code to generate a random number

First, we add the line `use rand::Rng;`. The `Rng` trait defines methods that
random number generators implement, and this trait must be in scope for us to
use those methods. Chapter 10 will cover traits in detail.

Next, we’re adding two lines in the middle. In the first line, we call the
`rand::thread_rng` function that gives us the particular random number
generator we’re going to use: one that is local to the current thread of
execution and is seeded by the operating system. Then, we call the `gen_range`
method on the random number generator. This method is defined by the `Rng`
trait that we brought into scope with the `use rand::Rng;` statement. The
`gen_range` method takes a range expression as an argument and generates a
random number in the range. The kind of range expression we’re using here
takes the form `start..=end` and is inclusive on the lower and upper bounds,
so we need to specify `1..=100` to request a number between 1 and 100.

Note: You won’t just know which traits to use and which methods and functions
to call from a crate, so each crate has documentation with instructions for
using it. Another neat feature of Cargo is that running the `cargo doc --open`
command will build documentation provided by all your dependencies locally and
open it in your browser. If you’re interested in other functionality in the
`rand` crate, for example, run `cargo doc --open` and click `rand` in the
sidebar on the left.

The second new line prints the secret number. This is useful while we’re
developing the program to be able to test it, but we’ll delete it from the
final version. It’s not much of a game if the program prints the answer as
soon as it starts!

Try running the program a few times:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Guess the number!
    The secret number is: 7
    Please input your guess.
    4
    You guessed: 4
    
    $ cargo run
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.02s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Guess the number!
    The secret number is: 83
    Please input your guess.
    5
    You guessed: 5
    

You should get different random numbers, and they should all be numbers
between 1 and 100. Great job!

## Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number

Now that we have user input and a random number, we can compare them. That
step is shown in Listing 2-4. Note that this code won’t compile just yet, as
we will explain.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        // --snip--
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }

Listing 2-4: Handling the possible return values of comparing two numbers

First, we add another `use` statement, bringing a type called
`std::cmp::Ordering` into scope from the standard library. The `Ordering` type
is another enum and has the variants `Less`, `Greater`, and `Equal`. These are
the three outcomes that are possible when you compare two values.

Then, we add five new lines at the bottom that use the `Ordering` type. The
`cmp` method compares two values and can be called on anything that can be
compared. It takes a reference to whatever you want to compare with: Here,
it’s comparing `guess` to `secret_number`. Then, it returns a variant of the
`Ordering` enum we brought into scope with the `use` statement. We use a
`match` expression to decide what to do next based on which variant of
`Ordering` was returned from the call to `cmp` with the values in `guess` and
`secret_number`.

A `match` expression is made up of _arms_. An arm consists of a _pattern_ to
match against, and the code that should be run if the value given to `match`
fits that arm’s pattern. Rust takes the value given to `match` and looks
through each arm’s pattern in turn. Patterns and the `match` construct are
powerful Rust features: They let you express a variety of situations your code
might encounter, and they make sure you handle them all. These features will
be covered in detail in Chapter 6 and Chapter 19, respectively.

Let’s walk through an example with the `match` expression we use here. Say
that the user has guessed 50 and the randomly generated secret number this
time is 38.

When the code compares 50 to 38, the `cmp` method will return
`Ordering::Greater` because 50 is greater than 38. The `match` expression gets
the `Ordering::Greater` value and starts checking each arm’s pattern. It looks
at the first arm’s pattern, `Ordering::Less`, and sees that the value
`Ordering::Greater` does not match `Ordering::Less`, so it ignores the code in
that arm and moves to the next arm. The next arm’s pattern is
`Ordering::Greater`, which _does_ match `Ordering::Greater`! The associated
code in that arm will execute and print `Too big!` to the screen. The `match`
expression ends after the first successful match, so it won’t look at the last
arm in this scenario.

However, the code in Listing 2-4 won’t compile yet. Let’s try it:

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
    error: could not compile `guessing_game` (bin "guessing_game") due to 1 previous error
    

The core of the error states that there are _mismatched types_. Rust has a
strong, static type system. However, it also has type inference. When we wrote
`let mut guess = String::new()`, Rust was able to infer that `guess` should be
a `String` and didn’t make us write the type. The `secret_number`, on the
other hand, is a number type. A few of Rust’s number types can have a value
between 1 and 100: `i32`, a 32-bit number; `u32`, an unsigned 32-bit number;
`i64`, a 64-bit number; as well as others. Unless otherwise specified, Rust
defaults to an `i32`, which is the type of `secret_number` unless you add type
information elsewhere that would cause Rust to infer a different numerical
type. The reason for the error is that Rust cannot compare a string and a
number type.

Ultimately, we want to convert the `String` the program reads as input into a
number type so that we can compare it numerically to the secret number. We do
so by adding this line to the `main` function body:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        // --snip--
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }

The line is:

    
    
    let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");

We create a variable named `guess`. But wait, doesn’t the program already have
a variable named `guess`? It does, but helpfully Rust allows us to shadow the
previous value of `guess` with a new one. _Shadowing_ lets us reuse the
`guess` variable name rather than forcing us to create two unique variables,
such as `guess_str` and `guess`, for example. We’ll cover this in more detail
in Chapter 3, but for now, know that this feature is often used when you want
to convert a value from one type to another type.

We bind this new variable to the expression `guess.trim().parse()`. The
`guess` in the expression refers to the original `guess` variable that
contained the input as a string. The `trim` method on a `String` instance will
eliminate any whitespace at the beginning and end, which we must do before we
can convert the string to a `u32`, which can only contain numerical data. The
user must press `enter` to satisfy `read_line` and input their guess, which
adds a newline character to the string. For example, if the user types `5` and
presses `enter`, `guess` looks like this: `5\n`. The `\n` represents
“newline.” (On Windows, pressing `enter` results in a carriage return and a
newline, `\r\n`.) The `trim` method eliminates `\n` or `\r\n`, resulting in
just `5`.

The [`parse` method on strings](../std/primitive.str.html#method.parse)
converts a string to another type. Here, we use it to convert from a string to
a number. We need to tell Rust the exact number type we want by using `let
guess: u32`. The colon (`:`) after `guess` tells Rust we’ll annotate the
variable’s type. Rust has a few built-in number types; the `u32` seen here is
an unsigned, 32-bit integer. It’s a good default choice for a small positive
number. You’ll learn about other number types in Chapter 3.

Additionally, the `u32` annotation in this example program and the comparison
with `secret_number` means Rust will infer that `secret_number` should be a
`u32` as well. So, now the comparison will be between two values of the same
type!

The `parse` method will only work on characters that can logically be
converted into numbers and so can easily cause errors. If, for example, the
string contained `A👍%`, there would be no way to convert that to a number.
Because it might fail, the `parse` method returns a `Result` type, much as the
`read_line` method does (discussed earlier in “Handling Potential Failure with
`Result`”). We’ll treat this `Result` the same way by using the `expect`
method again. If `parse` returns an `Err` `Result` variant because it couldn’t
create a number from the string, the `expect` call will crash the game and
print the message we give it. If `parse` can successfully convert the string
to a number, it will return the `Ok` variant of `Result`, and `expect` will
return the number that we want from the `Ok` value.

Let’s run the program now:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.26s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Guess the number!
    The secret number is: 58
    Please input your guess.
      76
    You guessed: 76
    Too big!
    

Nice! Even though spaces were added before the guess, the program still
figured out that the user guessed 76. Run the program a few times to verify
the different behavior with different kinds of input: Guess the number
correctly, guess a number that is too high, and guess a number that is too
low.

We have most of the game working now, but the user can make only one guess.
Let’s change that by adding a loop!

## Allowing Multiple Guesses with Looping

The `loop` keyword creates an infinite loop. We’ll add a loop to give users
more chances at guessing the number:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        // --snip--
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        loop {
            println!("Please input your guess.");
    
            // --snip--
    
    
            let mut guess = String::new();
    
            io::stdin()
                .read_line(&mut guess)
                .expect("Failed to read line");
    
            let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
    
            println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
            match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
                Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
                Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
            }
        }
    }

As you can see, we’ve moved everything from the guess input prompt onward into
a loop. Be sure to indent the lines inside the loop another four spaces each
and run the program again. The program will now ask for another guess forever,
which actually introduces a new problem. It doesn’t seem like the user can
quit!

The user could always interrupt the program by using the keyboard shortcut
`ctrl`-`C`. But there’s another way to escape this insatiable monster, as
mentioned in the `parse` discussion in “Comparing the Guess to the Secret
Number”: If the user enters a non-number answer, the program will crash. We
can take advantage of that to allow the user to quit, as shown here:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.23s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Guess the number!
    The secret number is: 59
    Please input your guess.
    45
    You guessed: 45
    Too small!
    Please input your guess.
    60
    You guessed: 60
    Too big!
    Please input your guess.
    59
    You guessed: 59
    You win!
    Please input your guess.
    quit
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:28:47:
    Please type a number!: ParseIntError { kind: InvalidDigit }
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    

Typing `quit` will quit the game, but as you’ll notice, so will entering any
other non-number input. This is suboptimal, to say the least; we want the game
to also stop when the correct number is guessed.

### Quitting After a Correct Guess

Let’s program the game to quit when the user wins by adding a `break`
statement:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        loop {
            println!("Please input your guess.");
    
            let mut guess = String::new();
    
            io::stdin()
                .read_line(&mut guess)
                .expect("Failed to read line");
    
            let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
    
            println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
            // --snip--
    
            match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
                Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
                Ordering::Equal => {
                    println!("You win!");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

Adding the `break` line after `You win!` makes the program exit the loop when
the user guesses the secret number correctly. Exiting the loop also means
exiting the program, because the loop is the last part of `main`.

### Handling Invalid Input

To further refine the game’s behavior, rather than crashing the program when
the user inputs a non-number, let’s make the game ignore a non-number so that
the user can continue guessing. We can do that by altering the line where
`guess` is converted from a `String` to a `u32`, as shown in Listing 2-5.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        loop {
            println!("Please input your guess.");
    
            let mut guess = String::new();
    
            // --snip--
    
            io::stdin()
                .read_line(&mut guess)
                .expect("Failed to read line");
    
            let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
                Ok(num) => num,
                Err(_) => continue,
            };
    
            println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
            // --snip--
    
            match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
                Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
                Ordering::Equal => {
                    println!("You win!");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

Listing 2-5: Ignoring a non-number guess and asking for another guess instead
of crashing the program

We switch from an `expect` call to a `match` expression to move from crashing
on an error to handling the error. Remember that `parse` returns a `Result`
type and `Result` is an enum that has the variants `Ok` and `Err`. We’re using
a `match` expression here, as we did with the `Ordering` result of the `cmp`
method.

If `parse` is able to successfully turn the string into a number, it will
return an `Ok` value that contains the resultant number. That `Ok` value will
match the first arm’s pattern, and the `match` expression will just return the
`num` value that `parse` produced and put inside the `Ok` value. That number
will end up right where we want it in the new `guess` variable we’re creating.

If `parse` is _not_ able to turn the string into a number, it will return an
`Err` value that contains more information about the error. The `Err` value
does not match the `Ok(num)` pattern in the first `match` arm, but it does
match the `Err(_)` pattern in the second arm. The underscore, `_`, is a catch-
all value; in this example, we’re saying we want to match all `Err` values, no
matter what information they have inside them. So, the program will execute
the second arm’s code, `continue`, which tells the program to go to the next
iteration of the `loop` and ask for another guess. So, effectively, the
program ignores all errors that `parse` might encounter!

Now everything in the program should work as expected. Let’s try it:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling guessing_game v0.1.0 (file:///projects/guessing_game)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.13s
         Running `target/debug/guessing_game`
    Guess the number!
    The secret number is: 61
    Please input your guess.
    10
    You guessed: 10
    Too small!
    Please input your guess.
    99
    You guessed: 99
    Too big!
    Please input your guess.
    foo
    Please input your guess.
    61
    You guessed: 61
    You win!
    

Awesome! With one tiny final tweak, we will finish the guessing game. Recall
that the program is still printing the secret number. That worked well for
testing, but it ruins the game. Let’s delete the `println!` that outputs the
secret number. Listing 2-6 shows the final code.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        loop {
            println!("Please input your guess.");
    
            let mut guess = String::new();
    
            io::stdin()
                .read_line(&mut guess)
                .expect("Failed to read line");
    
            let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
                Ok(num) => num,
                Err(_) => continue,
            };
    
            println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
            match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
                Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
                Ordering::Equal => {
                    println!("You win!");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

At this point, you’ve successfully built the guessing game. Congratulations!

## Summary

This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts:
`let`, `match`, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next
few chapters, you’ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3
covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data
types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. Chapter 4 explores
ownership, a feature that makes Rust different from other languages. Chapter 5
discusses structs and method syntax, and Chapter 6 explains how enums work.

# Common Programming Concepts

This chapter covers concepts that appear in almost every programming language
and how they work in Rust. Many programming languages have much in common at
their core. None of the concepts presented in this chapter are unique to Rust,
but we’ll discuss them in the context of Rust and explain the conventions
around using them.

Specifically, you’ll learn about variables, basic types, functions, comments,
and control flow. These foundations will be in every Rust program, and
learning them early will give you a strong core to start from.

#### Keywords

The Rust language has a set of _keywords_ that are reserved for use by the
language only, much as in other languages. Keep in mind that you cannot use
these words as names of variables or functions. Most of the keywords have
special meanings, and you’ll be using them to do various tasks in your Rust
programs; a few have no current functionality associated with them but have
been reserved for functionality that might be added to Rust in the future. You
can find the list of the keywords in Appendix A.

# Variables and Mutability

## Variables and Mutability

As mentioned in the “Storing Values with Variables” section, by default,
variables are immutable. This is one of many nudges Rust gives you to write
your code in a way that takes advantage of the safety and easy concurrency
that Rust offers. However, you still have the option to make your variables
mutable. Let’s explore how and why Rust encourages you to favor immutability
and why sometimes you might want to opt out.

When a variable is immutable, once a value is bound to a name, you can’t
change that value. To illustrate this, generate a new project called
_variables_ in your _projects_ directory by using `cargo new variables`.

Then, in your new _variables_ directory, open _src/main.rs_ and replace its
code with the following code, which won’t compile just yet:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
        x = 6;
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

Save and run the program using `cargo run`. You should receive an error
message regarding an immutability error, as shown in this output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    error[E0384]: cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x`
     --> src/main.rs:4:5
      |
    2 |     let x = 5;
      |         - first assignment to `x`
    3 |     println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    4 |     x = 6;
      |     ^^^^^ cannot assign twice to immutable variable
      |
    help: consider making this binding mutable
      |
    2 |     let mut x = 5;
      |         +++
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0384`.
    error: could not compile `variables` (bin "variables") due to 1 previous error
    

This example shows how the compiler helps you find errors in your programs.
Compiler errors can be frustrating, but really they only mean your program
isn’t safely doing what you want it to do yet; they do _not_ mean that you’re
not a good programmer! Experienced Rustaceans still get compiler errors.

You received the error message `cannot assign twice to immutable variable `x``
because you tried to assign a second value to the immutable `x` variable.

It’s important that we get compile-time errors when we attempt to change a
value that’s designated as immutable, because this very situation can lead to
bugs. If one part of our code operates on the assumption that a value will
never change and another part of our code changes that value, it’s possible
that the first part of the code won’t do what it was designed to do. The cause
of this kind of bug can be difficult to track down after the fact, especially
when the second piece of code changes the value only _sometimes_. The Rust
compiler guarantees that when you state that a value won’t change, it really
won’t change, so you don’t have to keep track of it yourself. Your code is
thus easier to reason through.

But mutability can be very useful and can make code more convenient to write.
Although variables are immutable by default, you can make them mutable by
adding `mut` in front of the variable name as you did in Chapter 2. Adding
`mut` also conveys intent to future readers of the code by indicating that
other parts of the code will be changing this variable’s value.

For example, let’s change _src/main.rs_ to the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut x = 5;
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
        x = 6;
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

When we run the program now, we get this:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
         Running `target/debug/variables`
    The value of x is: 5
    The value of x is: 6
    

We’re allowed to change the value bound to `x` from `5` to `6` when `mut` is
used. Ultimately, deciding whether to use mutability or not is up to you and
depends on what you think is clearest in that particular situation.

### Declaring Constants

Like immutable variables, _constants_ are values that are bound to a name and
are not allowed to change, but there are a few differences between constants
and variables.

First, you aren’t allowed to use `mut` with constants. Constants aren’t just
immutable by default—they’re always immutable. You declare constants using the
`const` keyword instead of the `let` keyword, and the type of the value _must_
be annotated. We’ll cover types and type annotations in the next section,
“Data Types”, so don’t worry about the details right now. Just know that you
must always annotate the type.

Constants can be declared in any scope, including the global scope, which
makes them useful for values that many parts of code need to know about.

The last difference is that constants may be set only to a constant
expression, not the result of a value that could only be computed at runtime.

Here’s an example of a constant declaration:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    const THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS: u32 = 60 * 60 * 3;
    }

The constant’s name is `THREE_HOURS_IN_SECONDS`, and its value is set to the
result of multiplying 60 (the number of seconds in a minute) by 60 (the number
of minutes in an hour) by 3 (the number of hours we want to count in this
program). Rust’s naming convention for constants is to use all uppercase with
underscores between words. The compiler is able to evaluate a limited set of
operations at compile time, which lets us choose to write out this value in a
way that’s easier to understand and verify, rather than setting this constant
to the value 10,800. See the [Rust Reference’s section on constant
evaluation](../reference/const_eval.html) for more information on what
operations can be used when declaring constants.

Constants are valid for the entire time a program runs, within the scope in
which they were declared. This property makes constants useful for values in
your application domain that multiple parts of the program might need to know
about, such as the maximum number of points any player of a game is allowed to
earn, or the speed of light.

Naming hardcoded values used throughout your program as constants is useful in
conveying the meaning of that value to future maintainers of the code. It also
helps to have only one place in your code that you would need to change if the
hardcoded value needed to be updated in the future.

### Shadowing

As you saw in the guessing game tutorial in Chapter 2, you can declare a new
variable with the same name as a previous variable. Rustaceans say that the
first variable is _shadowed_ by the second, which means that the second
variable is what the compiler will see when you use the name of the variable.
In effect, the second variable overshadows the first, taking any uses of the
variable name to itself until either it itself is shadowed or the scope ends.
We can shadow a variable by using the same variable’s name and repeating the
use of the `let` keyword as follows:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
    
        let x = x + 1;
    
        {
            let x = x * 2;
            println!("The value of x in the inner scope is: {x}");
        }
    
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

This program first binds `x` to a value of `5`. Then, it creates a new
variable `x` by repeating `let x =`, taking the original value and adding `1`
so that the value of `x` is `6`. Then, within an inner scope created with the
curly brackets, the third `let` statement also shadows `x` and creates a new
variable, multiplying the previous value by `2` to give `x` a value of `12`.
When that scope is over, the inner shadowing ends and `x` returns to being
`6`. When we run this program, it will output the following:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
         Running `target/debug/variables`
    The value of x in the inner scope is: 12
    The value of x is: 6
    

Shadowing is different from marking a variable as `mut` because we’ll get a
compile-time error if we accidentally try to reassign to this variable without
using the `let` keyword. By using `let`, we can perform a few transformations
on a value but have the variable be immutable after those transformations have
completed.

The other difference between `mut` and shadowing is that because we’re
effectively creating a new variable when we use the `let` keyword again, we
can change the type of the value but reuse the same name. For example, say our
program asks a user to show how many spaces they want between some text by
inputting space characters, and then we want to store that input as a number:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let spaces = "   ";
        let spaces = spaces.len();
    }

The first `spaces` variable is a string type, and the second `spaces` variable
is a number type. Shadowing thus spares us from having to come up with
different names, such as `spaces_str` and `spaces_num`; instead, we can reuse
the simpler `spaces` name. However, if we try to use `mut` for this, as shown
here, we’ll get a compile-time error:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut spaces = "   ";
        spaces = spaces.len();
    }

The error says we’re not allowed to mutate a variable’s type:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling variables v0.1.0 (file:///projects/variables)
    error[E0308]: mismatched types
     --> src/main.rs:3:14
      |
    2 |     let mut spaces = "   ";
      |                      ----- expected due to this value
    3 |     spaces = spaces.len();
      |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `&str`, found `usize`
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
    error: could not compile `variables` (bin "variables") due to 1 previous error
    

Now that we’ve explored how variables work, let’s look at more data types they
can have.

# Data Types

## Data Types

Every value in Rust is of a certain _data type_ , which tells Rust what kind
of data is being specified so that it knows how to work with that data. We’ll
look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Keep in mind that Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it
must know the types of all variables at compile time. The compiler can usually
infer what type we want to use based on the value and how we use it. In cases
when many types are possible, such as when we converted a `String` to a
numeric type using `parse` in the “Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number”
section in Chapter 2, we must add a type annotation, like this:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let guess: u32 = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
    }

If we don’t add the `: u32` type annotation shown in the preceding code, Rust
will display the following error, which means the compiler needs more
information from us to know which type we want to use:

    
    
    $ cargo build
       Compiling no_type_annotations v0.1.0 (file:///projects/no_type_annotations)
    error[E0284]: type annotations needed
     --> src/main.rs:2:9
      |
    2 |     let guess = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
      |         ^^^^^        ----- type must be known at this point
      |
      = note: cannot satisfy `<_ as FromStr>::Err == _`
    help: consider giving `guess` an explicit type
      |
    2 |     let guess: /* Type */ = "42".parse().expect("Not a number!");
      |              ++++++++++++
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0284`.
    error: could not compile `no_type_annotations` (bin "no_type_annotations") due to 1 previous error
    

You’ll see different type annotations for other data types.

### Scalar Types

A _scalar_ type represents a single value. Rust has four primary scalar types:
integers, floating-point numbers, Booleans, and characters. You may recognize
these from other programming languages. Let’s jump into how they work in Rust.

#### Integer Types

An _integer_ is a number without a fractional component. We used one integer
type in Chapter 2, the `u32` type. This type declaration indicates that the
value it’s associated with should be an unsigned integer (signed integer types
start with `i` instead of `u`) that takes up 32 bits of space. Table 3-1 shows
the built-in integer types in Rust. We can use any of these variants to
declare the type of an integer value.

Table 3-1: Integer Types in Rust

Length| Signed| Unsigned  
---|---|---  
8-bit| `i8`| `u8`  
16-bit| `i16`| `u16`  
32-bit| `i32`| `u32`  
64-bit| `i64`| `u64`  
128-bit| `i128`| `u128`  
Architecture-dependent| `isize`| `usize`  
  
Each variant can be either signed or unsigned and has an explicit size.
_Signed_ and _unsigned_ refer to whether it’s possible for the number to be
negative—in other words, whether the number needs to have a sign with it
(signed) or whether it will only ever be positive and can therefore be
represented without a sign (unsigned). It’s like writing numbers on paper:
When the sign matters, a number is shown with a plus sign or a minus sign;
however, when it’s safe to assume the number is positive, it’s shown with no
sign. Signed numbers are stored using [two’s
complement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement) representation.

Each signed variant can store numbers from −(2n − 1) to 2n − 1 − 1 inclusive,
where _n_ is the number of bits that variant uses. So, an `i8` can store
numbers from −(27) to 27 − 1, which equals −128 to 127. Unsigned variants can
store numbers from 0 to 2n − 1, so a `u8` can store numbers from 0 to 28 − 1,
which equals 0 to 255.

Additionally, the `isize` and `usize` types depend on the architecture of the
computer your program is running on: 64 bits if you’re on a 64-bit
architecture and 32 bits if you’re on a 32-bit architecture.

You can write integer literals in any of the forms shown in Table 3-2. Note
that number literals that can be multiple numeric types allow a type suffix,
such as `57u8`, to designate the type. Number literals can also use `_` as a
visual separator to make the number easier to read, such as `1_000`, which
will have the same value as if you had specified `1000`.

Table 3-2: Integer Literals in Rust

Number literals| Example  
---|---  
Decimal| `98_222`  
Hex| `0xff`  
Octal| `0o77`  
Binary| `0b1111_0000`  
Byte (`u8` only)| `b'A'`  
  
So how do you know which type of integer to use? If you’re unsure, Rust’s
defaults are generally good places to start: Integer types default to `i32`.
The primary situation in which you’d use `isize` or `usize` is when indexing
some sort of collection.

##### Integer Overflow

Let’s say you have a variable of type `u8` that can hold values between 0 and
255\. If you try to change the variable to a value outside that range, such as
256, _integer overflow_ will occur, which can result in one of two behaviors.
When you’re compiling in debug mode, Rust includes checks for integer overflow
that cause your program to _panic_ at runtime if this behavior occurs. Rust
uses the term _panicking_ when a program exits with an error; we’ll discuss
panics in more depth in the “Unrecoverable Errors with `panic!`” section in
Chapter 9.

When you’re compiling in release mode with the `--release` flag, Rust does
_not_ include checks for integer overflow that cause panics. Instead, if
overflow occurs, Rust performs _two’s complement wrapping_. In short, values
greater than the maximum value the type can hold “wrap around” to the minimum
of the values the type can hold. In the case of a `u8`, the value 256 becomes
0, the value 257 becomes 1, and so on. The program won’t panic, but the
variable will have a value that probably isn’t what you were expecting it to
have. Relying on integer overflow’s wrapping behavior is considered an error.

To explicitly handle the possibility of overflow, you can use these families
of methods provided by the standard library for primitive numeric types:

  * Wrap in all modes with the `wrapping_*` methods, such as `wrapping_add`.
  * Return the `None` value if there is overflow with the `checked_*` methods.
  * Return the value and a Boolean indicating whether there was overflow with the `overflowing_*` methods.
  * Saturate at the value’s minimum or maximum values with the `saturating_*` methods.

#### Floating-Point Types

Rust also has two primitive types for _floating-point numbers_ , which are
numbers with decimal points. Rust’s floating-point types are `f32` and `f64`,
which are 32 bits and 64 bits in size, respectively. The default type is `f64`
because on modern CPUs, it’s roughly the same speed as `f32` but is capable of
more precision. All floating-point types are signed.

Here’s an example that shows floating-point numbers in action:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = 2.0; // f64
    
        let y: f32 = 3.0; // f32
    }

Floating-point numbers are represented according to the IEEE-754 standard.

#### Numeric Operations

Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you’d expect for all the
number types: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and remainder.
Integer division truncates toward zero to the nearest integer. The following
code shows how you’d use each numeric operation in a `let` statement:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        // addition
        let sum = 5 + 10;
    
        // subtraction
        let difference = 95.5 - 4.3;
    
        // multiplication
        let product = 4 * 30;
    
        // division
        let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2;
        let truncated = -5 / 3; // Results in -1
    
        // remainder
        let remainder = 43 % 5;
    }

Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates
to a single value, which is then bound to a variable. Appendix B contains a
list of all operators that Rust provides.

#### The Boolean Type

As in most other programming languages, a Boolean type in Rust has two
possible values: `true` and `false`. Booleans are one byte in size. The
Boolean type in Rust is specified using `bool`. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let t = true;
    
        let f: bool = false; // with explicit type annotation
    }

The main way to use Boolean values is through conditionals, such as an `if`
expression. We’ll cover how `if` expressions work in Rust in the “Control
Flow” section.

#### The Character Type

Rust’s `char` type is the language’s most primitive alphabetic type. Here are
some examples of declaring `char` values:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let c = 'z';
        let z: char = 'ℤ'; // with explicit type annotation
        let heart_eyed_cat = '😻';
    }

Note that we specify `char` literals with single quotation marks, as opposed
to string literals, which use double quotation marks. Rust’s `char` type is 4
bytes in size and represents a Unicode scalar value, which means it can
represent a lot more than just ASCII. Accented letters; Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean characters; emojis; and zero-width spaces are all valid `char` values
in Rust. Unicode scalar values range from `U+0000` to `U+D7FF` and `U+E000` to
`U+10FFFF` inclusive. However, a “character” isn’t really a concept in
Unicode, so your human intuition for what a “character” is may not match up
with what a `char` is in Rust. We’ll discuss this topic in detail in “Storing
UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings” in Chapter 8.

### Compound Types

_Compound types_ can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two
primitive compound types: tuples and arrays.

#### The Tuple Type

A _tuple_ is a general way of grouping together a number of values with a
variety of types into one compound type. Tuples have a fixed length: Once
declared, they cannot grow or shrink in size.

We create a tuple by writing a comma-separated list of values inside
parentheses. Each position in the tuple has a type, and the types of the
different values in the tuple don’t have to be the same. We’ve added optional
type annotations in this example:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    }

The variable `tup` binds to the entire tuple because a tuple is considered a
single compound element. To get the individual values out of a tuple, we can
use pattern matching to destructure a tuple value, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let tup = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
        let (x, y, z) = tup;
    
        println!("The value of y is: {y}");
    }

This program first creates a tuple and binds it to the variable `tup`. It then
uses a pattern with `let` to take `tup` and turn it into three separate
variables, `x`, `y`, and `z`. This is called _destructuring_ because it breaks
the single tuple into three parts. Finally, the program prints the value of
`y`, which is `6.4`.

We can also access a tuple element directly by using a period (`.`) followed
by the index of the value we want to access. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);
    
        let five_hundred = x.0;
    
        let six_point_four = x.1;
    
        let one = x.2;
    }

This program creates the tuple `x` and then accesses each element of the tuple
using their respective indices. As with most programming languages, the first
index in a tuple is 0.

The tuple without any values has a special name, _unit_. This value and its
corresponding type are both written `()` and represent an empty value or an
empty return type. Expressions implicitly return the unit value if they don’t
return any other value.

#### The Array Type

Another way to have a collection of multiple values is with an _array_. Unlike
a tuple, every element of an array must have the same type. Unlike arrays in
some other languages, arrays in Rust have a fixed length.

We write the values in an array as a comma-separated list inside square
brackets:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    }

Arrays are useful when you want your data allocated on the stack, the same as
the other types we have seen so far, rather than the heap (we will discuss the
stack and the heap more in Chapter 4) or when you want to ensure that you
always have a fixed number of elements. An array isn’t as flexible as the
vector type, though. A vector is a similar collection type provided by the
standard library that _is_ allowed to grow or shrink in size because its
contents live on the heap. If you’re unsure whether to use an array or a
vector, chances are you should use a vector. Chapter 8 discusses vectors in
more detail.

However, arrays are more useful when you know the number of elements will not
need to change. For example, if you were using the names of the month in a
program, you would probably use an array rather than a vector because you know
it will always contain 12 elements:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let months = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July",
                  "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
    }

You write an array’s type using square brackets with the type of each element,
a semicolon, and then the number of elements in the array, like so:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    }

Here, `i32` is the type of each element. After the semicolon, the number `5`
indicates the array contains five elements.

You can also initialize an array to contain the same value for each element by
specifying the initial value, followed by a semicolon, and then the length of
the array in square brackets, as shown here:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let a = [3; 5];
    }

The array named `a` will contain `5` elements that will all be set to the
value `3` initially. This is the same as writing `let a = [3, 3, 3, 3, 3];`
but in a more concise way.

#### Array Element Access

An array is a single chunk of memory of a known, fixed size that can be
allocated on the stack. You can access elements of an array using indexing,
like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
        let first = a[0];
        let second = a[1];
    }

In this example, the variable named `first` will get the value `1` because
that is the value at index `[0]` in the array. The variable named `second`
will get the value `2` from index `[1]` in the array.

#### Invalid Array Element Access

Let’s see what happens if you try to access an element of an array that is
past the end of the array. Say you run this code, similar to the guessing game
in Chapter 2, to get an array index from the user:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
        println!("Please enter an array index.");
    
        let mut index = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut index)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        let index: usize = index
            .trim()
            .parse()
            .expect("Index entered was not a number");
    
        let element = a[index];
    
        println!("The value of the element at index {index} is: {element}");
    }

This code compiles successfully. If you run this code using `cargo run` and
enter `0`, `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4`, the program will print out the corresponding
value at that index in the array. If you instead enter a number past the end
of the array, such as `10`, you’ll see output like this:

    
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:19:19:
    index out of bounds: the len is 5 but the index is 10
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    

The program resulted in a runtime error at the point of using an invalid value
in the indexing operation. The program exited with an error message and didn’t
execute the final `println!` statement. When you attempt to access an element
using indexing, Rust will check that the index you’ve specified is less than
the array length. If the index is greater than or equal to the length, Rust
will panic. This check has to happen at runtime, especially in this case,
because the compiler can’t possibly know what value a user will enter when
they run the code later.

This is an example of Rust’s memory safety principles in action. In many low-
level languages, this kind of check is not done, and when you provide an
incorrect index, invalid memory can be accessed. Rust protects you against
this kind of error by immediately exiting instead of allowing the memory
access and continuing. Chapter 9 discusses more of Rust’s error handling and
how you can write readable, safe code that neither panics nor allows invalid
memory access.

# Functions

## Functions

Functions are prevalent in Rust code. You’ve already seen one of the most
important functions in the language: the `main` function, which is the entry
point of many programs. You’ve also seen the `fn` keyword, which allows you to
declare new functions.

Rust code uses _snake case_ as the conventional style for function and
variable names, in which all letters are lowercase and underscores separate
words. Here’s a program that contains an example function definition:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Hello, world!");
    
        another_function();
    }
    
    fn another_function() {
        println!("Another function.");
    }

We define a function in Rust by entering `fn` followed by a function name and
a set of parentheses. The curly brackets tell the compiler where the function
body begins and ends.

We can call any function we’ve defined by entering its name followed by a set
of parentheses. Because `another_function` is defined in the program, it can
be called from inside the `main` function. Note that we defined
`another_function` _after_ the `main` function in the source code; we could
have defined it before as well. Rust doesn’t care where you define your
functions, only that they’re defined somewhere in a scope that can be seen by
the caller.

Let’s start a new binary project named _functions_ to explore functions
further. Place the `another_function` example in _src/main.rs_ and run it. You
should see the following output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.28s
         Running `target/debug/functions`
    Hello, world!
    Another function.
    

The lines execute in the order in which they appear in the `main` function.
First the “Hello, world!” message prints, and then `another_function` is
called and its message is printed.

### Parameters

We can define functions to have _parameters_ , which are special variables
that are part of a function’s signature. When a function has parameters, you
can provide it with concrete values for those parameters. Technically, the
concrete values are called _arguments_ , but in casual conversation, people
tend to use the words _parameter_ and _argument_ interchangeably for either
the variables in a function’s definition or the concrete values passed in when
you call a function.

In this version of `another_function` we add a parameter:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        another_function(5);
    }
    
    fn another_function(x: i32) {
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

Try running this program; you should get the following output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.21s
         Running `target/debug/functions`
    The value of x is: 5
    

The declaration of `another_function` has one parameter named `x`. The type of
`x` is specified as `i32`. When we pass `5` in to `another_function`, the
`println!` macro puts `5` where the pair of curly brackets containing `x` was
in the format string.

In function signatures, you _must_ declare the type of each parameter. This is
a deliberate decision in Rust’s design: Requiring type annotations in function
definitions means the compiler almost never needs you to use them elsewhere in
the code to figure out what type you mean. The compiler is also able to give
more-helpful error messages if it knows what types the function expects.

When defining multiple parameters, separate the parameter declarations with
commas, like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        print_labeled_measurement(5, 'h');
    }
    
    fn print_labeled_measurement(value: i32, unit_label: char) {
        println!("The measurement is: {value}{unit_label}");
    }

This example creates a function named `print_labeled_measurement` with two
parameters. The first parameter is named `value` and is an `i32`. The second
is named `unit_label` and is type `char`. The function then prints text
containing both the `value` and the `unit_label`.

Let’s try running this code. Replace the program currently in your _functions_
project’s _src/main.rs_ file with the preceding example and run it using
`cargo run`:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
         Running `target/debug/functions`
    The measurement is: 5h
    

Because we called the function with `5` as the value for `value` and `'h'` as
the value for `unit_label`, the program output contains those values.

### Statements and Expressions

Function bodies are made up of a series of statements optionally ending in an
expression. So far, the functions we’ve covered haven’t included an ending
expression, but you have seen an expression as part of a statement. Because
Rust is an expression-based language, this is an important distinction to
understand. Other languages don’t have the same distinctions, so let’s look at
what statements and expressions are and how their differences affect the
bodies of functions.

  * _Statements_ are instructions that perform some action and do not return a value.
  * _Expressions_ evaluate to a resultant value.

Let’s look at some examples.

We’ve actually already used statements and expressions. Creating a variable
and assigning a value to it with the `let` keyword is a statement. In Listing
3-1, `let y = 6;` is a statement.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let y = 6;
    }

Listing 3-1: A `main` function declaration containing one statement

Function definitions are also statements; the entire preceding example is a
statement in itself. (As we’ll see shortly, calling a function is not a
statement, though.)

Statements do not return values. Therefore, you can’t assign a `let` statement
to another variable, as the following code tries to do; you’ll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = (let y = 6);
    }

When you run this program, the error you’ll get looks like this:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    error: expected expression, found `let` statement
     --> src/main.rs:2:14

    warning: unnecessary parentheses around assigned value
     --> src/main.rs:2:13
      |

    help: remove these parentheses
      |
    2 -     let x = (let y = 6);
    2 +     let x = let y = 6;
      |
    
    warning: `functions` (bin "functions") generated 1 warning
    error: could not compile `functions` (bin "functions") due to 1 previous error; 1 warning emitted
    

The `let y = 6` statement does not return a value, so there isn’t anything for
`x` to bind to. This is different from what happens in other languages, such
as C and Ruby, where the assignment returns the value of the assignment. In
those languages, you can write `x = y = 6` and have both `x` and `y` have the
value `6`; that is not the case in Rust.

Expressions evaluate to a value and make up most of the rest of the code that
you’ll write in Rust. Consider a math operation, such as `5 + 6`, which is an
expression that evaluates to the value `11`. Expressions can be part of
statements: In Listing 3-1, the `6` in the statement `let y = 6;` is an
expression that evaluates to the value `6`. Calling a function is an
expression. Calling a macro is an expression. A new scope block created with
curly brackets is an expression, for example:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let y = {
            let x = 3;
            x + 1
        };
    
        println!("The value of y is: {y}");
    }

This expression:

    
    
    {
        let x = 3;
        x + 1
    }

is a block that, in this case, evaluates to `4`. That value gets bound to `y`
as part of the `let` statement. Note the `x + 1` line without a semicolon at
the end, which is unlike most of the lines you’ve seen so far. Expressions do
not include ending semicolons. If you add a semicolon to the end of an
expression, you turn it into a statement, and it will then not return a value.
Keep this in mind as you explore function return values and expressions next.

### Functions with Return Values

Functions can return values to the code that calls them. We don’t name return
values, but we must declare their type after an arrow (`->`). In Rust, the
return value of the function is synonymous with the value of the final
expression in the block of the body of a function. You can return early from a
function by using the `return` keyword and specifying a value, but most
functions return the last expression implicitly. Here’s an example of a
function that returns a value:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn five() -> i32 {
        5
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let x = five();
    
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }

There are no function calls, macros, or even `let` statements in the `five`
function—just the number `5` by itself. That’s a perfectly valid function in
Rust. Note that the function’s return type is specified too, as `-> i32`. Try
running this code; the output should look like this:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
         Running `target/debug/functions`
    The value of x is: 5
    

The `5` in `five` is the function’s return value, which is why the return type
is `i32`. Let’s examine this in more detail. There are two important bits:
First, the line `let x = five();` shows that we’re using the return value of a
function to initialize a variable. Because the function `five` returns a `5`,
that line is the same as the following:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let x = 5;
    }

Second, the `five` function has no parameters and defines the type of the
return value, but the body of the function is a lonely `5` with no semicolon
because it’s an expression whose value we want to return.

Let’s look at another example:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);
    
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }
    
    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1
    }

Running this code will print `The value of x is: 6`. But what happens if we
place a semicolon at the end of the line containing `x + 1`, changing it from
an expression to a statement?

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = plus_one(5);
    
        println!("The value of x is: {x}");
    }
    
    fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
        x + 1;
    }

Compiling this code will produce an error, as follows:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling functions v0.1.0 (file:///projects/functions)
    error[E0308]: mismatched types
     --> src/main.rs:7:24
      |
    7 | fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
      |    --------            ^^^ expected `i32`, found `()`
      |    |
      |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
    8 |     x + 1;
      |          - help: remove this semicolon to return this value
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
    error: could not compile `functions` (bin "functions") due to 1 previous error
    

The main error message, `mismatched types`, reveals the core issue with this
code. The definition of the function `plus_one` says that it will return an
`i32`, but statements don’t evaluate to a value, which is expressed by `()`,
the unit type. Therefore, nothing is returned, which contradicts the function
definition and results in an error. In this output, Rust provides a message to
possibly help rectify this issue: It suggests removing the semicolon, which
would fix the error.

# Comments

## Comments

All programmers strive to make their code easy to understand, but sometimes
extra explanation is warranted. In these cases, programmers leave _comments_
in their source code that the compiler will ignore but that people reading the
source code may find useful.

Here’s a simple comment:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    // hello, world
    }

In Rust, the idiomatic comment style starts a comment with two slashes, and
the comment continues until the end of the line. For comments that extend
beyond a single line, you’ll need to include `//` on each line, like this:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    // So we're doing something complicated here, long enough that we need
    // multiple lines of comments to do it! Whew! Hopefully, this comment will
    // explain what's going on.
    }

Comments can also be placed at the end of lines containing code:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let lucky_number = 7; // I'm feeling lucky today
    }

But you’ll more often see them used in this format, with the comment on a
separate line above the code it’s annotating:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        // I'm feeling lucky today
        let lucky_number = 7;
    }

Rust also has another kind of comment, documentation comments, which we’ll
discuss in the “Publishing a Crate to Crates.io” section of Chapter 14.

# Control Flow

## Control Flow

The ability to run some code depending on whether a condition is `true` and
the ability to run some code repeatedly while a condition is `true` are basic
building blocks in most programming languages. The most common constructs that
let you control the flow of execution of Rust code are `if` expressions and
loops.

### `if` Expressions

An `if` expression allows you to branch your code depending on conditions. You
provide a condition and then state, “If this condition is met, run this block
of code. If the condition is not met, do not run this block of code.”

Create a new project called _branches_ in your _projects_ directory to explore
the `if` expression. In the _src/main.rs_ file, input the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number = 3;
    
        if number < 5 {
            println!("condition was true");
        } else {
            println!("condition was false");
        }
    }

All `if` expressions start with the keyword `if`, followed by a condition. In
this case, the condition checks whether or not the variable `number` has a
value less than 5. We place the block of code to execute if the condition is
`true` immediately after the condition inside curly brackets. Blocks of code
associated with the conditions in `if` expressions are sometimes called _arms_
, just like the arms in `match` expressions that we discussed in the
“Comparing the Guess to the Secret Number” section of Chapter 2.

Optionally, we can also include an `else` expression, which we chose to do
here, to give the program an alternative block of code to execute should the
condition evaluate to `false`. If you don’t provide an `else` expression and
the condition is `false`, the program will just skip the `if` block and move
on to the next bit of code.

Try running this code; you should see the following output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
         Running `target/debug/branches`
    condition was true
    

Let’s try changing the value of `number` to a value that makes the condition
`false` to see what happens:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number = 7;
    
        if number < 5 {
            println!("condition was true");
        } else {
            println!("condition was false");
        }
    }

Run the program again, and look at the output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
         Running `target/debug/branches`
    condition was false
    

It’s also worth noting that the condition in this code _must_ be a `bool`. If
the condition isn’t a `bool`, we’ll get an error. For example, try running the
following code:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number = 3;
    
        if number {
            println!("number was three");
        }
    }

The `if` condition evaluates to a value of `3` this time, and Rust throws an
error:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    error[E0308]: mismatched types
     --> src/main.rs:4:8
      |
    4 |     if number {
      |        ^^^^^^ expected `bool`, found integer
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
    error: could not compile `branches` (bin "branches") due to 1 previous error
    

The error indicates that Rust expected a `bool` but got an integer. Unlike
languages such as Ruby and JavaScript, Rust will not automatically try to
convert non-Boolean types to a Boolean. You must be explicit and always
provide `if` with a Boolean as its condition. If we want the `if` code block
to run only when a number is not equal to `0`, for example, we can change the
`if` expression to the following:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number = 3;
    
        if number != 0 {
            println!("number was something other than zero");
        }
    }

Running this code will print `number was something other than zero`.

#### Handling Multiple Conditions with `else if`

You can use multiple conditions by combining `if` and `else` in an `else if`
expression. For example:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number = 6;
    
        if number % 4 == 0 {
            println!("number is divisible by 4");
        } else if number % 3 == 0 {
            println!("number is divisible by 3");
        } else if number % 2 == 0 {
            println!("number is divisible by 2");
        } else {
            println!("number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2");
        }
    }

This program has four possible paths it can take. After running it, you should
see the following output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.31s
         Running `target/debug/branches`
    number is divisible by 3
    

When this program executes, it checks each `if` expression in turn and
executes the first body for which the condition evaluates to `true`. Note that
even though 6 is divisible by 2, we don’t see the output `number is divisible
by 2`, nor do we see the `number is not divisible by 4, 3, or 2` text from the
`else` block. That’s because Rust only executes the block for the first `true`
condition, and once it finds one, it doesn’t even check the rest.

Using too many `else if` expressions can clutter your code, so if you have
more than one, you might want to refactor your code. Chapter 6 describes a
powerful Rust branching construct called `match` for these cases.

#### Using `if` in a `let` Statement

Because `if` is an expression, we can use it on the right side of a `let`
statement to assign the outcome to a variable, as in Listing 3-2.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let condition = true;
        let number = if condition { 5 } else { 6 };
    
        println!("The value of number is: {number}");
    }

Listing 3-2: Assigning the result of an `if` expression to a variable

The `number` variable will be bound to a value based on the outcome of the
`if` expression. Run this code to see what happens:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.30s
         Running `target/debug/branches`
    The value of number is: 5
    

Remember that blocks of code evaluate to the last expression in them, and
numbers by themselves are also expressions. In this case, the value of the
whole `if` expression depends on which block of code executes. This means the
values that have the potential to be results from each arm of the `if` must be
the same type; in Listing 3-2, the results of both the `if` arm and the `else`
arm were `i32` integers. If the types are mismatched, as in the following
example, we’ll get an error:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let condition = true;
    
        let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
    
        println!("The value of number is: {number}");
    }

When we try to compile this code, we’ll get an error. The `if` and `else` arms
have value types that are incompatible, and Rust indicates exactly where to
find the problem in the program:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling branches v0.1.0 (file:///projects/branches)
    error[E0308]: `if` and `else` have incompatible types
     --> src/main.rs:4:44
      |
    4 |     let number = if condition { 5 } else { "six" };
      |                                 -          ^^^^^ expected integer, found `&str`
      |                                 |
      |                                 expected because of this
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
    error: could not compile `branches` (bin "branches") due to 1 previous error
    

The expression in the `if` block evaluates to an integer, and the expression
in the `else` block evaluates to a string. This won’t work, because variables
must have a single type, and Rust needs to know definitively at compile time
what type the `number` variable is. Knowing the type of `number` lets the
compiler verify the type is valid everywhere we use `number`. Rust wouldn’t be
able to do that if the type of `number` was only determined at runtime; the
compiler would be more complex and would make fewer guarantees about the code
if it had to keep track of multiple hypothetical types for any variable.

### Repetition with Loops

It’s often useful to execute a block of code more than once. For this task,
Rust provides several _loops_ , which will run through the code inside the
loop body to the end and then start immediately back at the beginning. To
experiment with loops, let’s make a new project called _loops_.

Rust has three kinds of loops: `loop`, `while`, and `for`. Let’s try each one.

#### Repeating Code with `loop`

The `loop` keyword tells Rust to execute a block of code over and over again
either forever or until you explicitly tell it to stop.

As an example, change the _src/main.rs_ file in your _loops_ directory to look
like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        loop {
            println!("again!");
        }
    }

When we run this program, we’ll see `again!` printed over and over
continuously until we stop the program manually. Most terminals support the
keyboard shortcut `ctrl`-`C` to interrupt a program that is stuck in a
continual loop. Give it a try:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.08s
         Running `target/debug/loops`
    again!
    again!
    again!
    again!
    ^Cagain!
    

The symbol `^C` represents where you pressed `ctrl`-`C`.

You may or may not see the word `again!` printed after the `^C`, depending on
where the code was in the loop when it received the interrupt signal.

Fortunately, Rust also provides a way to break out of a loop using code. You
can place the `break` keyword within the loop to tell the program when to stop
executing the loop. Recall that we did this in the guessing game in the
“Quitting After a Correct Guess” section of Chapter 2 to exit the program when
the user won the game by guessing the correct number.

We also used `continue` in the guessing game, which in a loop tells the
program to skip over any remaining code in this iteration of the loop and go
to the next iteration.

#### Returning Values from Loops

One of the uses of a `loop` is to retry an operation you know might fail, such
as checking whether a thread has completed its job. You might also need to
pass the result of that operation out of the loop to the rest of your code. To
do this, you can add the value you want returned after the `break` expression
you use to stop the loop; that value will be returned out of the loop so that
you can use it, as shown here:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut counter = 0;
    
        let result = loop {
            counter += 1;
    
            if counter == 10 {
                break counter * 2;
            }
        };
    
        println!("The result is {result}");
    }

Before the loop, we declare a variable named `counter` and initialize it to
`0`. Then, we declare a variable named `result` to hold the value returned
from the loop. On every iteration of the loop, we add `1` to the `counter`
variable, and then check whether the `counter` is equal to `10`. When it is,
we use the `break` keyword with the value `counter * 2`. After the loop, we
use a semicolon to end the statement that assigns the value to `result`.
Finally, we print the value in `result`, which in this case is `20`.

You can also `return` from inside a loop. While `break` only exits the current
loop, `return` always exits the current function.

#### Disambiguating with Loop Labels

If you have loops within loops, `break` and `continue` apply to the innermost
loop at that point. You can optionally specify a _loop label_ on a loop that
you can then use with `break` or `continue` to specify that those keywords
apply to the labeled loop instead of the innermost loop. Loop labels must
begin with a single quote. Here’s an example with two nested loops:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut count = 0;
        'counting_up: loop {
            println!("count = {count}");
            let mut remaining = 10;
    
            loop {
                println!("remaining = {remaining}");
                if remaining == 9 {
                    break;
                }
                if count == 2 {
                    break 'counting_up;
                }
                remaining -= 1;
            }
    
            count += 1;
        }
        println!("End count = {count}");
    }

The outer loop has the label `'counting_up`, and it will count up from 0 to 2.
The inner loop without a label counts down from 10 to 9. The first `break`
that doesn’t specify a label will exit the inner loop only. The `break
'counting_up;` statement will exit the outer loop. This code prints:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s
         Running `target/debug/loops`
    count = 0
    remaining = 10
    remaining = 9
    count = 1
    remaining = 10
    remaining = 9
    count = 2
    remaining = 10
    End count = 2
    

#### Streamlining Conditional Loops with while

A program will often need to evaluate a condition within a loop. While the
condition is `true`, the loop runs. When the condition ceases to be `true`,
the program calls `break`, stopping the loop. It’s possible to implement
behavior like this using a combination of `loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`;
you could try that now in a program, if you’d like. However, this pattern is
so common that Rust has a built-in language construct for it, called a `while`
loop. In Listing 3-3, we use `while` to loop the program three times, counting
down each time, and then, after the loop, to print a message and exit.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut number = 3;
    
        while number != 0 {
            println!("{number}!");
    
            number -= 1;
        }
    
        println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
    }

Listing 3-3: Using a `while` loop to run code while a condition evaluates to
`true`

This construct eliminates a lot of nesting that would be necessary if you used
`loop`, `if`, `else`, and `break`, and it’s clearer. While a condition
evaluates to `true`, the code runs; otherwise, it exits the loop.

#### Looping Through a Collection with `for`

You can choose to use the `while` construct to loop over the elements of a
collection, such as an array. For example, the loop in Listing 3-4 prints each
element in the array `a`.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
        let mut index = 0;
    
        while index < 5 {
            println!("the value is: {}", a[index]);
    
            index += 1;
        }
    }

Listing 3-4: Looping through each element of a collection using a `while` loop

Here, the code counts up through the elements in the array. It starts at index
`0` and then loops until it reaches the final index in the array (that is,
when `index < 5` is no longer `true`). Running this code will print every
element in the array:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling loops v0.1.0 (file:///projects/loops)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.32s
         Running `target/debug/loops`
    the value is: 10
    the value is: 20
    the value is: 30
    the value is: 40
    the value is: 50
    

All five array values appear in the terminal, as expected. Even though `index`
will reach a value of `5` at some point, the loop stops executing before
trying to fetch a sixth value from the array.

However, this approach is error-prone; we could cause the program to panic if
the index value or test condition is incorrect. For example, if you changed
the definition of the `a` array to have four elements but forgot to update the
condition to `while index < 4`, the code would panic. It’s also slow, because
the compiler adds runtime code to perform the conditional check of whether the
index is within the bounds of the array on every iteration through the loop.

As a more concise alternative, you can use a `for` loop and execute some code
for each item in a collection. A `for` loop looks like the code in Listing
3-5.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let a = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50];
    
        for element in a {
            println!("the value is: {element}");
        }
    }

Listing 3-5: Looping through each element of a collection using a `for` loop

When we run this code, we’ll see the same output as in Listing 3-4. More
importantly, we’ve now increased the safety of the code and eliminated the
chance of bugs that might result from going beyond the end of the array or not
going far enough and missing some items. Machine code generated from `for`
loops can be more efficient as well because the index doesn’t need to be
compared to the length of the array at every iteration.

Using the `for` loop, you wouldn’t need to remember to change any other code
if you changed the number of values in the array, as you would with the method
used in Listing 3-4.

The safety and conciseness of `for` loops make them the most commonly used
loop construct in Rust. Even in situations in which you want to run some code
a certain number of times, as in the countdown example that used a `while`
loop in Listing 3-3, most Rustaceans would use a `for` loop. The way to do
that would be to use a `Range`, provided by the standard library, which
generates all numbers in sequence starting from one number and ending before
another number.

Here’s what the countdown would look like using a `for` loop and another
method we’ve not yet talked about, `rev`, to reverse the range:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        for number in (1..4).rev() {
            println!("{number}!");
        }
        println!("LIFTOFF!!!");
    }

This code is a bit nicer, isn’t it?

## Summary

You made it! This was a sizable chapter: You learned about variables, scalar
and compound data types, functions, comments, `if` expressions, and loops! To
practice with the concepts discussed in this chapter, try building programs to
do the following:

  * Convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
  * Generate the _n_ th Fibonacci number.
  * Print the lyrics to the Christmas carol “The Twelve Days of Christmas,” taking advantage of the repetition in the song.

When you’re ready to move on, we’ll talk about a concept in Rust that
_doesn’t_ commonly exist in other programming languages: ownership.

# Understanding Ownership

Ownership is Rust’s most unique feature and has deep implications for the rest
of the language. It enables Rust to make memory safety guarantees without
needing a garbage collector, so it’s important to understand how ownership
works. In this chapter, we’ll talk about ownership as well as several related
features: borrowing, slices, and how Rust lays data out in memory.

# What is Ownership?

## What Is Ownership?

_Ownership_ is a set of rules that govern how a Rust program manages memory.
All programs have to manage the way they use a computer’s memory while
running. Some languages have garbage collection that regularly looks for no-
longer-used memory as the program runs; in other languages, the programmer
must explicitly allocate and free the memory. Rust uses a third approach:
Memory is managed through a system of ownership with a set of rules that the
compiler checks. If any of the rules are violated, the program won’t compile.
None of the features of ownership will slow down your program while it’s
running.

Because ownership is a new concept for many programmers, it does take some
time to get used to. The good news is that the more experienced you become
with Rust and the rules of the ownership system, the easier you’ll find it to
naturally develop code that is safe and efficient. Keep at it!

When you understand ownership, you’ll have a solid foundation for
understanding the features that make Rust unique. In this chapter, you’ll
learn ownership by working through some examples that focus on a very common
data structure: strings.

### The Stack and the Heap

Many programming languages don’t require you to think about the stack and the
heap very often. But in a systems programming language like Rust, whether a
value is on the stack or the heap affects how the language behaves and why you
have to make certain decisions. Parts of ownership will be described in
relation to the stack and the heap later in this chapter, so here is a brief
explanation in preparation.

Both the stack and the heap are parts of memory available to your code to use
at runtime, but they are structured in different ways. The stack stores values
in the order it gets them and removes the values in the opposite order. This
is referred to as _last in, first out (LIFO)_. Think of a stack of plates:
When you add more plates, you put them on top of the pile, and when you need a
plate, you take one off the top. Adding or removing plates from the middle or
bottom wouldn’t work as well! Adding data is called _pushing onto the stack_ ,
and removing data is called _popping off the stack_. All data stored on the
stack must have a known, fixed size. Data with an unknown size at compile time
or a size that might change must be stored on the heap instead.

The heap is less organized: When you put data on the heap, you request a
certain amount of space. The memory allocator finds an empty spot in the heap
that is big enough, marks it as being in use, and returns a _pointer_ , which
is the address of that location. This process is called _allocating on the
heap_ and is sometimes abbreviated as just _allocating_ (pushing values onto
the stack is not considered allocating). Because the pointer to the heap is a
known, fixed size, you can store the pointer on the stack, but when you want
the actual data, you must follow the pointer. Think of being seated at a
restaurant. When you enter, you state the number of people in your group, and
the host finds an empty table that fits everyone and leads you there. If
someone in your group comes late, they can ask where you’ve been seated to
find you.

Pushing to the stack is faster than allocating on the heap because the
allocator never has to search for a place to store new data; that location is
always at the top of the stack. Comparatively, allocating space on the heap
requires more work because the allocator must first find a big enough space to
hold the data and then perform bookkeeping to prepare for the next allocation.

Accessing data in the heap is generally slower than accessing data on the
stack because you have to follow a pointer to get there. Contemporary
processors are faster if they jump around less in memory. Continuing the
analogy, consider a server at a restaurant taking orders from many tables.
It’s most efficient to get all the orders at one table before moving on to the
next table. Taking an order from table A, then an order from table B, then one
from A again, and then one from B again would be a much slower process. By the
same token, a processor can usually do its job better if it works on data
that’s close to other data (as it is on the stack) rather than farther away
(as it can be on the heap).

When your code calls a function, the values passed into the function
(including, potentially, pointers to data on the heap) and the function’s
local variables get pushed onto the stack. When the function is over, those
values get popped off the stack.

Keeping track of what parts of code are using what data on the heap,
minimizing the amount of duplicate data on the heap, and cleaning up unused
data on the heap so that you don’t run out of space are all problems that
ownership addresses. Once you understand ownership, you won’t need to think
about the stack and the heap very often. But knowing that the main purpose of
ownership is to manage heap data can help explain why it works the way it
does.

### Ownership Rules

First, let’s take a look at the ownership rules. Keep these rules in mind as
we work through the examples that illustrate them:

  * Each value in Rust has an _owner_.
  * There can only be one owner at a time.
  * When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

### Variable Scope

Now that we’re past basic Rust syntax, we won’t include all the `fn main() {`
code in the examples, so if you’re following along, make sure to put the
following examples inside a `main` function manually. As a result, our
examples will be a bit more concise, letting us focus on the actual details
rather than boilerplate code.

As a first example of ownership, we’ll look at the scope of some variables. A
_scope_ is the range within a program for which an item is valid. Take the
following variable:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = "hello";
    }

The variable `s` refers to a string literal, where the value of the string is
hardcoded into the text of our program. The variable is valid from the point
at which it’s declared until the end of the current scope. Listing 4-1 shows a
program with comments annotating where the variable `s` would be valid.

    
    
    fn main() {
        {                      // s is not valid here, since it's not yet declared
            let s = "hello";   // s is valid from this point forward
    
            // do stuff with s
        }                      // this scope is now over, and s is no longer valid
    }

Listing 4-1: A variable and the scope in which it is valid

In other words, there are two important points in time here:

  * When `s` comes _into_ scope, it is valid.
  * It remains valid until it goes _out of_ scope.

At this point, the relationship between scopes and when variables are valid is
similar to that in other programming languages. Now we’ll build on top of this
understanding by introducing the `String` type.

### The `String` Type

To illustrate the rules of ownership, we need a data type that is more complex
than those we covered in the “Data Types” section of Chapter 3. The types
covered previously are of a known size, can be stored on the stack and popped
off the stack when their scope is over, and can be quickly and trivially
copied to make a new, independent instance if another part of code needs to
use the same value in a different scope. But we want to look at data that is
stored on the heap and explore how Rust knows when to clean up that data, and
the `String` type is a great example.

We’ll concentrate on the parts of `String` that relate to ownership. These
aspects also apply to other complex data types, whether they are provided by
the standard library or created by you. We’ll discuss non-ownership aspects of
`String` in Chapter 8.

We’ve already seen string literals, where a string value is hardcoded into our
program. String literals are convenient, but they aren’t suitable for every
situation in which we may want to use text. One reason is that they’re
immutable. Another is that not every string value can be known when we write
our code: For example, what if we want to take user input and store it? It is
for these situations that Rust has the `String` type. This type manages data
allocated on the heap and as such is able to store an amount of text that is
unknown to us at compile time. You can create a `String` from a string literal
using the `from` function, like so:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    }

The double colon `::` operator allows us to namespace this particular `from`
function under the `String` type rather than using some sort of name like
`string_from`. We’ll discuss this syntax more in the “Methods” section of
Chapter 5, and when we talk about namespacing with modules in “Paths for
Referring to an Item in the Module Tree” in Chapter 7.

This kind of string _can_ be mutated:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
        s.push_str(", world!"); // push_str() appends a literal to a String
    
        println!("{s}"); // this will print `hello, world!`
    }

So, what’s the difference here? Why can `String` be mutated but literals
cannot? The difference is in how these two types deal with memory.

### Memory and Allocation

In the case of a string literal, we know the contents at compile time, so the
text is hardcoded directly into the final executable. This is why string
literals are fast and efficient. But these properties only come from the
string literal’s immutability. Unfortunately, we can’t put a blob of memory
into the binary for each piece of text whose size is unknown at compile time
and whose size might change while running the program.

With the `String` type, in order to support a mutable, growable piece of text,
we need to allocate an amount of memory on the heap, unknown at compile time,
to hold the contents. This means:

  * The memory must be requested from the memory allocator at runtime.
  * We need a way of returning this memory to the allocator when we’re done with our `String`.

That first part is done by us: When we call `String::from`, its implementation
requests the memory it needs. This is pretty much universal in programming
languages.

However, the second part is different. In languages with a _garbage collector
(GC)_ , the GC keeps track of and cleans up memory that isn’t being used
anymore, and we don’t need to think about it. In most languages without a GC,
it’s our responsibility to identify when memory is no longer being used and to
call code to explicitly free it, just as we did to request it. Doing this
correctly has historically been a difficult programming problem. If we forget,
we’ll waste memory. If we do it too early, we’ll have an invalid variable. If
we do it twice, that’s a bug too. We need to pair exactly one `allocate` with
exactly one `free`.

Rust takes a different path: The memory is automatically returned once the
variable that owns it goes out of scope. Here’s a version of our scope example
from Listing 4-1 using a `String` instead of a string literal:

    
    
    fn main() {
        {
            let s = String::from("hello"); // s is valid from this point forward
    
            // do stuff with s
        }                                  // this scope is now over, and s is no
                                           // longer valid
    }

There is a natural point at which we can return the memory our `String` needs
to the allocator: when `s` goes out of scope. When a variable goes out of
scope, Rust calls a special function for us. This function is called
[`drop`](../std/ops/trait.Drop.html#tymethod.drop), and it’s where the author
of `String` can put the code to return the memory. Rust calls `drop`
automatically at the closing curly bracket.

Note: In C++, this pattern of deallocating resources at the end of an item’s
lifetime is sometimes called _Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)_.
The `drop` function in Rust will be familiar to you if you’ve used RAII
patterns.

This pattern has a profound impact on the way Rust code is written. It may
seem simple right now, but the behavior of code can be unexpected in more
complicated situations when we want to have multiple variables use the data
we’ve allocated on the heap. Let’s explore some of those situations now.

#### Variables and Data Interacting with Move

Multiple variables can interact with the same data in different ways in Rust.
Listing 4-2 shows an example using an integer.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        let y = x;
    }

Listing 4-2: Assigning the integer value of variable `x` to `y`

We can probably guess what this is doing: “Bind the value `5` to `x`; then,
make a copy of the value in `x` and bind it to `y`.” We now have two
variables, `x` and `y`, and both equal `5`. This is indeed what is happening,
because integers are simple values with a known, fixed size, and these two `5`
values are pushed onto the stack.

Now let’s look at the `String` version:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
        let s2 = s1;
    }

This looks very similar, so we might assume that the way it works would be the
same: That is, the second line would make a copy of the value in `s1` and bind
it to `s2`. But this isn’t quite what happens.

Take a look at Figure 4-1 to see what is happening to `String` under the
covers. A `String` is made up of three parts, shown on the left: a pointer to
the memory that holds the contents of the string, a length, and a capacity.
This group of data is stored on the stack. On the right is the memory on the
heap that holds the contents.

![Two tables: the first table contains the representation of s1 on the

stack, consisting of its length \(5\), capacity \(5\), and a pointer to the
first

value in the second table. The second table contains the representation of the

string data on the heap, byte by byte.](img/trpl04-01.svg)

Figure 4-1: The representation in memory of a `String` holding the value
`"hello"` bound to `s1`

The length is how much memory, in bytes, the contents of the `String` are
currently using. The capacity is the total amount of memory, in bytes, that
the `String` has received from the allocator. The difference between length
and capacity matters, but not in this context, so for now, it’s fine to ignore
the capacity.

When we assign `s1` to `s2`, the `String` data is copied, meaning we copy the
pointer, the length, and the capacity that are on the stack. We do not copy
the data on the heap that the pointer refers to. In other words, the data
representation in memory looks like Figure 4-2.

![Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the

stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the
heap.](img/trpl04-02.svg)

Figure 4-2: The representation in memory of the variable `s2` that has a copy
of the pointer, length, and capacity of `s1`

The representation does _not_ look like Figure 4-3, which is what memory would
look like if Rust instead copied the heap data as well. If Rust did this, the
operation `s2 = s1` could be very expensive in terms of runtime performance if
the data on the heap were large.

![Four tables: two tables representing the stack data for s1 and s2,

and each points to its own copy of string data on the
heap.](img/trpl04-03.svg)

Figure 4-3: Another possibility for what `s2 = s1` might do if Rust copied the
heap data as well

Earlier, we said that when a variable goes out of scope, Rust automatically
calls the `drop` function and cleans up the heap memory for that variable. But
Figure 4-2 shows both data pointers pointing to the same location. This is a
problem: When `s2` and `s1` go out of scope, they will both try to free the
same memory. This is known as a _double free_ error and is one of the memory
safety bugs we mentioned previously. Freeing memory twice can lead to memory
corruption, which can potentially lead to security vulnerabilities.

To ensure memory safety, after the line `let s2 = s1;`, Rust considers `s1` as
no longer valid. Therefore, Rust doesn’t need to free anything when `s1` goes
out of scope. Check out what happens when you try to use `s1` after `s2` is
created; it won’t work:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
        let s2 = s1;
    
        println!("{s1}, world!");
    }

You’ll get an error like this because Rust prevents you from using the
invalidated reference:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
    error[E0382]: borrow of moved value: `s1`

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0382`.
    error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
    

If you’ve heard the terms _shallow copy_ and _deep copy_ while working with
other languages, the concept of copying the pointer, length, and capacity
without copying the data probably sounds like making a shallow copy. But
because Rust also invalidates the first variable, instead of being called a
shallow copy, it’s known as a _move_. In this example, we would say that `s1`
was _moved_ into `s2`. So, what actually happens is shown in Figure 4-4.

![Three tables: tables s1 and s2 representing those strings on the

stack, respectively, and both pointing to the same string data on the heap.

Table s1 is grayed out because s1 is no longer valid; only s2 can be used to

access the heap data.](img/trpl04-04.svg)

Figure 4-4: The representation in memory after `s1` has been invalidated

That solves our problem! With only `s2` valid, when it goes out of scope it
alone will free the memory, and we’re done.

In addition, there’s a design choice that’s implied by this: Rust will never
automatically create “deep” copies of your data. Therefore, any _automatic_
copying can be assumed to be inexpensive in terms of runtime performance.

#### Scope and Assignment

The inverse of this is true for the relationship between scoping, ownership,
and memory being freed via the `drop` function as well. When you assign a
completely new value to an existing variable, Rust will call `drop` and free
the original value’s memory immediately. Consider this code, for example:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
        s = String::from("ahoy");
    
        println!("{s}, world!");
    }

We initially declare a variable `s` and bind it to a `String` with the value
`"hello"`. Then, we immediately create a new `String` with the value `"ahoy"`
and assign it to `s`. At this point, nothing is referring to the original
value on the heap at all. Figure 4-5 illustrates the stack and heap data now:

![One table representing the string value on the stack, pointing to

the second piece of string data \(ahoy\) on the heap, with the original string

data \(hello\) grayed out because it cannot be accessed
anymore.](img/trpl04-05.svg)

Figure 4-5: The representation in memory after the initial value has been
replaced in its entirety

The original string thus immediately goes out of scope. Rust will run the
`drop` function on it and its memory will be freed right away. When we print
the value at the end, it will be `"ahoy, world!"`.

#### Variables and Data Interacting with Clone

If we _do_ want to deeply copy the heap data of the `String`, not just the
stack data, we can use a common method called `clone`. We’ll discuss method
syntax in Chapter 5, but because methods are a common feature in many
programming languages, you’ve probably seen them before.

Here’s an example of the `clone` method in action:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
        let s2 = s1.clone();
    
        println!("s1 = {s1}, s2 = {s2}");
    }

This works just fine and explicitly produces the behavior shown in Figure 4-3,
where the heap data _does_ get copied.

When you see a call to `clone`, you know that some arbitrary code is being
executed and that code may be expensive. It’s a visual indicator that
something different is going on.

#### Stack-Only Data: Copy

There’s another wrinkle we haven’t talked about yet. This code using
integers—part of which was shown in Listing 4-2—works and is valid:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;
        let y = x;
    
        println!("x = {x}, y = {y}");
    }

But this code seems to contradict what we just learned: We don’t have a call
to `clone`, but `x` is still valid and wasn’t moved into `y`.

The reason is that types such as integers that have a known size at compile
time are stored entirely on the stack, so copies of the actual values are
quick to make. That means there’s no reason we would want to prevent `x` from
being valid after we create the variable `y`. In other words, there’s no
difference between deep and shallow copying here, so calling `clone` wouldn’t
do anything different from the usual shallow copying, and we can leave it out.

Rust has a special annotation called the `Copy` trait that we can place on
types that are stored on the stack, as integers are (we’ll talk more about
traits in Chapter 10). If a type implements the `Copy` trait, variables that
use it do not move, but rather are trivially copied, making them still valid
after assignment to another variable.

Rust won’t let us annotate a type with `Copy` if the type, or any of its
parts, has implemented the `Drop` trait. If the type needs something special
to happen when the value goes out of scope and we add the `Copy` annotation to
that type, we’ll get a compile-time error. To learn about how to add the
`Copy` annotation to your type to implement the trait, see “Derivable Traits”
in Appendix C.

So, what types implement the `Copy` trait? You can check the documentation for
the given type to be sure, but as a general rule, any group of simple scalar
values can implement `Copy`, and nothing that requires allocation or is some
form of resource can implement `Copy`. Here are some of the types that
implement `Copy`:

  * All the integer types, such as `u32`.
  * The Boolean type, `bool`, with values `true` and `false`.
  * All the floating-point types, such as `f64`.
  * The character type, `char`.
  * Tuples, if they only contain types that also implement `Copy`. For example, `(i32, i32)` implements `Copy`, but `(i32, String)` does not.

### Ownership and Functions

The mechanics of passing a value to a function are similar to those when
assigning a value to a variable. Passing a variable to a function will move or
copy, just as assignment does. Listing 4-3 has an example with some
annotations showing where variables go into and out of scope.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s = String::from("hello");  // s comes into scope
    
        takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function...
                                        // ... and so is no longer valid here
    
        let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope
    
        makes_copy(x);                  // Because i32 implements the Copy trait,
                                        // x does NOT move into the function,
                                        // so it's okay to use x afterward.
    
    } // Here, x goes out of scope, then s. However, because s's value was moved,
      // nothing special happens.
    
    fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
        println!("{some_string}");
    } // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. The backing
      // memory is freed.
    
    fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
        println!("{some_integer}");
    } // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.

Listing 4-3: Functions with ownership and scope annotated

If we tried to use `s` after the call to `takes_ownership`, Rust would throw a
compile-time error. These static checks protect us from mistakes. Try adding
code to `main` that uses `s` and `x` to see where you can use them and where
the ownership rules prevent you from doing so.

### Return Values and Scope

Returning values can also transfer ownership. Listing 4-4 shows an example of
a function that returns some value, with similar annotations as those in
Listing 4-3.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = gives_ownership();        // gives_ownership moves its return
                                           // value into s1
    
        let s2 = String::from("hello");    // s2 comes into scope
    
        let s3 = takes_and_gives_back(s2); // s2 is moved into
                                           // takes_and_gives_back, which also
                                           // moves its return value into s3
    } // Here, s3 goes out of scope and is dropped. s2 was moved, so nothing
      // happens. s1 goes out of scope and is dropped.
    
    fn gives_ownership() -> String {       // gives_ownership will move its
                                           // return value into the function
                                           // that calls it
    
        let some_string = String::from("yours"); // some_string comes into scope
    
        some_string                        // some_string is returned and
                                           // moves out to the calling
                                           // function
    }
    
    // This function takes a String and returns a String.
    fn takes_and_gives_back(a_string: String) -> String {
        // a_string comes into
        // scope
    
        a_string  // a_string is returned and moves out to the calling function
    }

Listing 4-4: Transferring ownership of return values

The ownership of a variable follows the same pattern every time: Assigning a
value to another variable moves it. When a variable that includes data on the
heap goes out of scope, the value will be cleaned up by `drop` unless
ownership of the data has been moved to another variable.

While this works, taking ownership and then returning ownership with every
function is a bit tedious. What if we want to let a function use a value but
not take ownership? It’s quite annoying that anything we pass in also needs to
be passed back if we want to use it again, in addition to any data resulting
from the body of the function that we might want to return as well.

Rust does let us return multiple values using a tuple, as shown in Listing
4-5.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
    
        let (s2, len) = calculate_length(s1);
    
        println!("The length of '{s2}' is {len}.");
    }
    
    fn calculate_length(s: String) -> (String, usize) {
        let length = s.len(); // len() returns the length of a String
    
        (s, length)
    }

Listing 4-5: Returning ownership of parameters

But this is too much ceremony and a lot of work for a concept that should be
common. Luckily for us, Rust has a feature for using a value without
transferring ownership: references.

# References and Borrowing

## References and Borrowing

The issue with the tuple code in Listing 4-5 is that we have to return the
`String` to the calling function so that we can still use the `String` after
the call to `calculate_length`, because the `String` was moved into
`calculate_length`. Instead, we can provide a reference to the `String` value.
A reference is like a pointer in that it’s an address we can follow to access
the data stored at that address; that data is owned by some other variable.
Unlike a pointer, a reference is guaranteed to point to a valid value of a
particular type for the life of that reference.

Here is how you would define and use a `calculate_length` function that has a
reference to an object as a parameter instead of taking ownership of the
value:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
    
        let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    
        println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
    }
    
    fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
        s.len()
    }

First, notice that all the tuple code in the variable declaration and the
function return value is gone. Second, note that we pass `&s1` into
`calculate_length` and, in its definition, we take `&String` rather than
`String`. These ampersands represent references, and they allow you to refer
to some value without taking ownership of it. Figure 4-6 depicts this concept.

![Three tables: the table for s contains only a pointer to the table

for s1. The table for s1 contains the stack data for s1 and points to the

string data on the heap.](img/trpl04-06.svg)

Figure 4-6: A diagram of `&String` `s` pointing at `String` `s1`

Note: The opposite of referencing by using `&` is _dereferencing_ , which is
accomplished with the dereference operator, `*`. We’ll see some uses of the
dereference operator in Chapter 8 and discuss details of dereferencing in
Chapter 15.

Let’s take a closer look at the function call here:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
    
        let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    
        println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
    }
    
    fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
        s.len()
    }

The `&s1` syntax lets us create a reference that _refers_ to the value of `s1`
but does not own it. Because the reference does not own it, the value it
points to will not be dropped when the reference stops being used.

Likewise, the signature of the function uses `&` to indicate that the type of
the parameter `s` is a reference. Let’s add some explanatory annotations:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hello");
    
        let len = calculate_length(&s1);
    
        println!("The length of '{s1}' is {len}.");
    }
    
    fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize { // s is a reference to a String
        s.len()
    } // Here, s goes out of scope. But because s does not have ownership of what
      // it refers to, the String is not dropped.

The scope in which the variable `s` is valid is the same as any function
parameter’s scope, but the value pointed to by the reference is not dropped
when `s` stops being used, because `s` doesn’t have ownership. When functions
have references as parameters instead of the actual values, we won’t need to
return the values in order to give back ownership, because we never had
ownership.

We call the action of creating a reference _borrowing_. As in real life, if a
person owns something, you can borrow it from them. When you’re done, you have
to give it back. You don’t own it.

So, what happens if we try to modify something we’re borrowing? Try the code
in Listing 4-6. Spoiler alert: It doesn’t work!

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s = String::from("hello");
    
        change(&s);
    }
    
    fn change(some_string: &String) {
        some_string.push_str(", world");

Just as variables are immutable by default, so are references. We’re not
allowed to modify something we have a reference to.

### Mutable References

We can fix the code from Listing 4-6 to allow us to modify a borrowed value
with just a few small tweaks that use, instead, a _mutable reference_ :

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
        change(&mut s);
    }
    
    fn change(some_string: &mut String) {
        some_string.push_str(", world");
    }

First, we change `s` to be `mut`. Then, we create a mutable reference with
`&mut s` where we call the `change` function and update the function signature
to accept a mutable reference with `some_string: &mut String`. This makes it
very clear that the `change` function will mutate the value it borrows.

Mutable references have one big restriction: If you have a mutable reference
to a value, you can have no other references to that value. This code that
attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
        let r1 = &mut s;
        let r2 = &mut s;
    
        println!("{r1}, {r2}");
    }

Here’s the error:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)
    error[E0499]: cannot borrow `s` as mutable more than once at a time

      |              ^^^^^^ second mutable borrow occurs here
    6 |
    7 |     println!("{r1}, {r2}");
      |                -- first borrow later used here
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0499`.
    error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
    

This error says that this code is invalid because we cannot borrow `s` as
mutable more than once at a time. The first mutable borrow is in `r1` and must
last until it’s used in the `println!`, but between the creation of that
mutable reference and its usage, we tried to create another mutable reference
in `r2` that borrows the same data as `r1`.

The restriction preventing multiple mutable references to the same data at the
same time allows for mutation but in a very controlled fashion. It’s something
that new Rustaceans struggle with because most languages let you mutate
whenever you’d like. The benefit of having this restriction is that Rust can
prevent data races at compile time. A _data race_ is similar to a race
condition and happens when these three behaviors occur:

  * Two or more pointers access the same data at the same time.
  * At least one of the pointers is being used to write to the data.
  * There’s no mechanism being used to synchronize access to the data.

Data races cause undefined behavior and can be difficult to diagnose and fix
when you’re trying to track them down at runtime; Rust prevents this problem
by refusing to compile code with data races!

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for
multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
        {
            let r1 = &mut s;
        } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.
    
        let r2 = &mut s;
    }

Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references.
This code results in an error:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
        let r1 = &s; // no problem
        let r2 = &s; // no problem
        let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM
    
        println!("{r1}, {r2}, and {r3}");
    }

Here’s the error:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling ownership v0.1.0 (file:///projects/ownership)

    error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
    

Whew! We _also_ cannot have a mutable reference while we have an immutable one
to the same value.

Users of an immutable reference don’t expect the value to suddenly change out
from under them! However, multiple immutable references are allowed because no
one who is just reading the data has the ability to affect anyone else’s
reading of the data.

Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues
through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will
compile because the last usage of the immutable references is in the
`println!`, before the mutable reference is introduced:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello");
    
        let r1 = &s; // no problem
        let r2 = &s; // no problem
        println!("{r1} and {r2}");
        // Variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point.
    
        let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
        println!("{r3}");
    }

The scopes of the immutable references `r1` and `r2` end after the `println!`
where they are last used, which is before the mutable reference `r3` is
created. These scopes don’t overlap, so this code is allowed: The compiler can
tell that the reference is no longer being used at a point before the end of
the scope.

Even though borrowing errors may be frustrating at times, remember that it’s
the Rust compiler pointing out a potential bug early (at compile time rather
than at runtime) and showing you exactly where the problem is. Then, you don’t
have to track down why your data isn’t what you thought it was.

### Dangling References

In languages with pointers, it’s easy to erroneously create a _dangling
pointer_ —a pointer that references a location in memory that may have been
given to someone else—by freeing some memory while preserving a pointer to
that memory. In Rust, by contrast, the compiler guarantees that references
will never be dangling references: If you have a reference to some data, the
compiler will ensure that the data will not go out of scope before the
reference to the data does.

Let’s try to create a dangling reference to see how Rust prevents them with a
compile-time error:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
    }
    
    fn dangle() -> &String {
        let s = String::from("hello");
    
        &s
    }

Here’s the error:

    
    
    $ cargo run

    error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
    

This error message refers to a feature we haven’t covered yet: lifetimes.
We’ll discuss lifetimes in detail in Chapter 10. But, if you disregard the
parts about lifetimes, the message does contain the key to why this code is a
problem:

    
    
    this function's return type contains a borrowed value, but there is no value
    for it to be borrowed from
    

Let’s take a closer look at exactly what’s happening at each stage of our
`dangle` code:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let reference_to_nothing = dangle();
    }
    
    fn dangle() -> &String { // dangle returns a reference to a String
    
        let s = String::from("hello"); // s is a new String
    
        &s // we return a reference to the String, s
    } // Here, s goes out of scope and is dropped, so its memory goes away.
      // Danger!

Because `s` is created inside `dangle`, when the code of `dangle` is finished,
`s` will be deallocated. But we tried to return a reference to it. That means
this reference would be pointing to an invalid `String`. That’s no good! Rust
won’t let us do this.

The solution here is to return the `String` directly:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let string = no_dangle();
    }
    
    fn no_dangle() -> String {
        let s = String::from("hello");
    
        s
    }

This works without any problems. Ownership is moved out, and nothing is
deallocated.

### The Rules of References

Let’s recap what we’ve discussed about references:

  * At any given time, you can have _either_ one mutable reference _or_ any number of immutable references.
  * References must always be valid.

Next, we’ll look at a different kind of reference: slices.

# The Slice Type

## The Slice Type

_Slices_ let you reference a contiguous sequence of elements in a collection.
A slice is a kind of reference, so it does not have ownership.

Here’s a small programming problem: Write a function that takes a string of
words separated by spaces and returns the first word it finds in that string.
If the function doesn’t find a space in the string, the whole string must be
one word, so the entire string should be returned.

Note: For the purposes of introducing slices, we are assuming ASCII only in
this section; a more thorough discussion of UTF-8 handling is in the “Storing
UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings” section of Chapter 8.

Let’s work through how we’d write the signature of this function without using
slices, to understand the problem that slices will solve:

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> ?

The `first_word` function has a parameter of type `&String`. We don’t need
ownership, so this is fine. (In idiomatic Rust, functions do not take
ownership of their arguments unless they need to, and the reasons for that
will become clear as we keep going.) But what should we return? We don’t
really have a way to talk about _part_ of a string. However, we could return
the index of the end of the word, indicated by a space. Let’s try that, as
shown in Listing 4-7.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return i;
            }
        }
    
        s.len()
    }
    
    fn main() {}

Listing 4-7: The `first_word` function that returns a byte index value into
the `String` parameter

Because we need to go through the `String` element by element and check
whether a value is a space, we’ll convert our `String` to an array of bytes
using the `as_bytes` method.

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return i;
            }
        }
    
        s.len()
    }
    
    fn main() {}

Next, we create an iterator over the array of bytes using the `iter` method:

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return i;
            }
        }
    
        s.len()
    }
    
    fn main() {}

We’ll discuss iterators in more detail in Chapter 13. For now, know that
`iter` is a method that returns each element in a collection and that
`enumerate` wraps the result of `iter` and returns each element as part of a
tuple instead. The first element of the tuple returned from `enumerate` is the
index, and the second element is a reference to the element. This is a bit
more convenient than calculating the index ourselves.

Because the `enumerate` method returns a tuple, we can use patterns to
destructure that tuple. We’ll be discussing patterns more in Chapter 6. In the
`for` loop, we specify a pattern that has `i` for the index in the tuple and
`&item` for the single byte in the tuple. Because we get a reference to the
element from `.iter().enumerate()`, we use `&` in the pattern.

Inside the `for` loop, we search for the byte that represents the space by
using the byte literal syntax. If we find a space, we return the position.
Otherwise, we return the length of the string by using `s.len()`.

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return i;
            }
        }
    
        s.len()
    }
    
    fn main() {}

We now have a way to find out the index of the end of the first word in the
string, but there’s a problem. We’re returning a `usize` on its own, but it’s
only a meaningful number in the context of the `&String`. In other words,
because it’s a separate value from the `String`, there’s no guarantee that it
will still be valid in the future. Consider the program in Listing 4-8 that
uses the `first_word` function from Listing 4-7.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> usize {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return i;
            }
        }
    
        s.len()
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello world");
    
        let word = first_word(&s); // word will get the value 5
    
        s.clear(); // this empties the String, making it equal to ""
    
        // word still has the value 5 here, but s no longer has any content that we
        // could meaningfully use with the value 5, so word is now totally invalid!
    }

Listing 4-8: Storing the result from calling the `first_word` function and
then changing the `String` contents

This program compiles without any errors and would also do so if we used
`word` after calling `s.clear()`. Because `word` isn’t connected to the state
of `s` at all, `word` still contains the value `5`. We could use that value
`5` with the variable `s` to try to extract the first word out, but this would
be a bug because the contents of `s` have changed since we saved `5` in
`word`.

Having to worry about the index in `word` getting out of sync with the data in
`s` is tedious and error-prone! Managing these indices is even more brittle if
we write a `second_word` function. Its signature would have to look like this:

    
    
    fn second_word(s: &String) -> (usize, usize) {

Now we’re tracking a starting _and_ an ending index, and we have even more
values that were calculated from data in a particular state but aren’t tied to
that state at all. We have three unrelated variables floating around that need
to be kept in sync.

Luckily, Rust has a solution to this problem: string slices.

### String Slices

A _string slice_ is a reference to a contiguous sequence of the elements of a
`String`, and it looks like this:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s = String::from("hello world");
    
        let hello = &s[0..5];
        let world = &s[6..11];
    }

Rather than a reference to the entire `String`, `hello` is a reference to a
portion of the `String`, specified in the extra `[0..5]` bit. We create slices
using a range within square brackets by specifying
`[starting_index..ending_index]`, where _`starting_index`_ is the first
position in the slice and _`ending_index`_ is one more than the last position
in the slice. Internally, the slice data structure stores the starting
position and the length of the slice, which corresponds to _`ending_index`_
minus _`starting_index`_. So, in the case of `let world = &s[6..11];`, `world`
would be a slice that contains a pointer to the byte at index 6 of `s` with a
length value of `5`.

Figure 4-7 shows this in a diagram.

![Three tables: a table representing the stack data of s, which points

to the byte at index 0 in a table of the string data "hello world" on

the heap. The third table represents the stack data of the slice world, which

has a length value of 5 and points to byte 6 of the heap data
table.](img/trpl04-07.svg)

Figure 4-7: A string slice referring to part of a `String`

With Rust’s `..` range syntax, if you want to start at index 0, you can drop
the value before the two periods. In other words, these are equal:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    
    let slice = &s[0..2];
    let slice = &s[..2];
    }

By the same token, if your slice includes the last byte of the `String`, you
can drop the trailing number. That means these are equal:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    
    let len = s.len();
    
    let slice = &s[3..len];
    let slice = &s[3..];
    }

You can also drop both values to take a slice of the entire string. So, these
are equal:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello");
    
    let len = s.len();
    
    let slice = &s[0..len];
    let slice = &s[..];
    }

Note: String slice range indices must occur at valid UTF-8 character
boundaries. If you attempt to create a string slice in the middle of a
multibyte character, your program will exit with an error.

With all this information in mind, let’s rewrite `first_word` to return a
slice. The type that signifies “string slice” is written as `&str`:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return &s[0..i];
            }
        }
    
        &s[..]
    }
    
    fn main() {}

We get the index for the end of the word the same way we did in Listing 4-7,
by looking for the first occurrence of a space. When we find a space, we
return a string slice using the start of the string and the index of the space
as the starting and ending indices.

Now when we call `first_word`, we get back a single value that is tied to the
underlying data. The value is made up of a reference to the starting point of
the slice and the number of elements in the slice.

Returning a slice would also work for a `second_word` function:

    
    
    fn second_word(s: &String) -> &str {

We now have a straightforward API that’s much harder to mess up because the
compiler will ensure that the references into the `String` remain valid.
Remember the bug in the program in Listing 4-8, when we got the index to the
end of the first word but then cleared the string so our index was invalid?
That code was logically incorrect but didn’t show any immediate errors. The
problems would show up later if we kept trying to use the first word index
with an emptied string. Slices make this bug impossible and let us know much
sooner that we have a problem with our code. Using the slice version of
`first_word` will throw a compile-time error:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return &s[0..i];
            }
        }
    
        &s[..]
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("hello world");
    
        let word = first_word(&s);
    
        s.clear(); // error!
    
        println!("the first word is: {word}");
    }

Here’s the compiler error:

    
    
    $ cargo run

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
    error: could not compile `ownership` (bin "ownership") due to 1 previous error
    

Recall from the borrowing rules that if we have an immutable reference to
something, we cannot also take a mutable reference. Because `clear` needs to
truncate the `String`, it needs to get a mutable reference. The `println!`
after the call to `clear` uses the reference in `word`, so the immutable
reference must still be active at that point. Rust disallows the mutable
reference in `clear` and the immutable reference in `word` from existing at
the same time, and compilation fails. Not only has Rust made our API easier to
use, but it has also eliminated an entire class of errors at compile time!

#### String Literals as Slices

Recall that we talked about string literals being stored inside the binary.
Now that we know about slices, we can properly understand string literals:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = "Hello, world!";
    }

The type of `s` here is `&str`: It’s a slice pointing to that specific point
of the binary. This is also why string literals are immutable; `&str` is an
immutable reference.

#### String Slices as Parameters

Knowing that you can take slices of literals and `String` values leads us to
one more improvement on `first_word`, and that’s its signature:

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &String) -> &str {

A more experienced Rustacean would write the signature shown in Listing 4-9
instead because it allows us to use the same function on both `&String` values
and `&str` values.

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return &s[0..i];
            }
        }
    
        &s[..]
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let my_string = String::from("hello world");
    
        // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole.
        let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
        let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
        // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
        // to whole slices of `String`s.
        let word = first_word(&my_string);
    
        let my_string_literal = "hello world";
    
        // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or
        // whole.
        let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
        let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);
    
        // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
        // this works too, without the slice syntax!
        let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
    }

Listing 4-9: Improving the `first_word` function by using a string slice for
the type of the `s` parameter

If we have a string slice, we can pass that directly. If we have a `String`,
we can pass a slice of the `String` or a reference to the `String`. This
flexibility takes advantage of deref coercions, a feature we will cover in the
“Using Deref Coercions in Functions and Methods” section of Chapter 15.

Defining a function to take a string slice instead of a reference to a
`String` makes our API more general and useful without losing any
functionality:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn first_word(s: &str) -> &str {
        let bytes = s.as_bytes();
    
        for (i, &item) in bytes.iter().enumerate() {
            if item == b' ' {
                return &s[0..i];
            }
        }
    
        &s[..]
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let my_string = String::from("hello world");
    
        // `first_word` works on slices of `String`s, whether partial or whole.
        let word = first_word(&my_string[0..6]);
        let word = first_word(&my_string[..]);
        // `first_word` also works on references to `String`s, which are equivalent
        // to whole slices of `String`s.
        let word = first_word(&my_string);
    
        let my_string_literal = "hello world";
    
        // `first_word` works on slices of string literals, whether partial or
        // whole.
        let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[0..6]);
        let word = first_word(&my_string_literal[..]);
    
        // Because string literals *are* string slices already,
        // this works too, without the slice syntax!
        let word = first_word(my_string_literal);
    }

### Other Slices

String slices, as you might imagine, are specific to strings. But there’s a
more general slice type too. Consider this array:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    }

Just as we might want to refer to part of a string, we might want to refer to
part of an array. We’d do so like this:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
    let slice = &a[1..3];
    
    assert_eq!(slice, &[2, 3]);
    }

This slice has the type `&[i32]`. It works the same way as string slices do,
by storing a reference to the first element and a length. You’ll use this kind
of slice for all sorts of other collections. We’ll discuss these collections
in detail when we talk about vectors in Chapter 8.

## Summary

The concepts of ownership, borrowing, and slices ensure memory safety in Rust
programs at compile time. The Rust language gives you control over your memory
usage in the same way as other systems programming languages. But having the
owner of data automatically clean up that data when the owner goes out of
scope means you don’t have to write and debug extra code to get this control.

Ownership affects how lots of other parts of Rust work, so we’ll talk about
these concepts further throughout the rest of the book. Let’s move on to
Chapter 5 and look at grouping pieces of data together in a `struct`.

# Using Structs to Structure Related Data

A _struct_ , or _structure_ , is a custom data type that lets you package
together and name multiple related values that make up a meaningful group. If
you’re familiar with an object-oriented language, a struct is like an object’s
data attributes. In this chapter, we’ll compare and contrast tuples with
structs to build on what you already know and demonstrate when structs are a
better way to group data.

We’ll demonstrate how to define and instantiate structs. We’ll discuss how to
define associated functions, especially the kind of associated functions
called _methods_ , to specify behavior associated with a struct type. Structs
and enums (discussed in Chapter 6) are the building blocks for creating new
types in your program’s domain to take full advantage of Rust’s compile-time
type checking.

# Defining and Instantiating Structs

## Defining and Instantiating Structs

Structs are similar to tuples, discussed in “The Tuple Type” section, in that
both hold multiple related values. Like tuples, the pieces of a struct can be
different types. Unlike with tuples, in a struct you’ll name each piece of
data so it’s clear what the values mean. Adding these names means that structs
are more flexible than tuples: You don’t have to rely on the order of the data
to specify or access the values of an instance.

To define a struct, we enter the keyword `struct` and name the entire struct.
A struct’s name should describe the significance of the pieces of data being
grouped together. Then, inside curly brackets, we define the names and types
of the pieces of data, which we call _fields_. For example, Listing 5-1 shows
a struct that stores information about a user account.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn main() {}

Listing 5-1: A `User` struct definition

To use a struct after we’ve defined it, we create an _instance_ of that struct
by specifying concrete values for each of the fields. We create an instance by
stating the name of the struct and then add curly brackets containing _`key:
value`_ pairs, where the keys are the names of the fields and the values are
the data we want to store in those fields. We don’t have to specify the fields
in the same order in which we declared them in the struct. In other words, the
struct definition is like a general template for the type, and instances fill
in that template with particular data to create values of the type. For
example, we can declare a particular user as shown in Listing 5-2.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let user1 = User {
            active: true,
            username: String::from("someusername123"),
            email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
            sign_in_count: 1,
        };
    }

Listing 5-2: Creating an instance of the `User` struct

To get a specific value from a struct, we use dot notation. For example, to
access this user’s email address, we use `user1.email`. If the instance is
mutable, we can change a value by using the dot notation and assigning into a
particular field. Listing 5-3 shows how to change the value in the `email`
field of a mutable `User` instance.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let mut user1 = User {
            active: true,
            username: String::from("someusername123"),
            email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
            sign_in_count: 1,
        };
    
        user1.email = String::from("anotheremail@example.com");
    }

Listing 5-3: Changing the value in the `email` field of a `User` instance

Note that the entire instance must be mutable; Rust doesn’t allow us to mark
only certain fields as mutable. As with any expression, we can construct a new
instance of the struct as the last expression in the function body to
implicitly return that new instance.

Listing 5-4 shows a `build_user` function that returns a `User` instance with
the given email and username. The `active` field gets the value `true`, and
the `sign_in_count` gets a value of `1`.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            active: true,
            username: username,
            email: email,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let user1 = build_user(
            String::from("someone@example.com"),
            String::from("someusername123"),
        );
    }

Listing 5-4: A `build_user` function that takes an email and username and
returns a `User` instance

It makes sense to name the function parameters with the same name as the
struct fields, but having to repeat the `email` and `username` field names and
variables is a bit tedious. If the struct had more fields, repeating each name
would get even more annoying. Luckily, there’s a convenient shorthand!

### Using the Field Init Shorthand

Because the parameter names and the struct field names are exactly the same in
Listing 5-4, we can use the _field init shorthand_ syntax to rewrite
`build_user` so that it behaves exactly the same but doesn’t have the
repetition of `username` and `email`, as shown in Listing 5-5.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn build_user(email: String, username: String) -> User {
        User {
            active: true,
            username,
            email,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let user1 = build_user(
            String::from("someone@example.com"),
            String::from("someusername123"),
        );
    }

Listing 5-5: A `build_user` function that uses field init shorthand because
the `username` and `email` parameters have the same name as struct fields

Here, we’re creating a new instance of the `User` struct, which has a field
named `email`. We want to set the `email` field’s value to the value in the
`email` parameter of the `build_user` function. Because the `email` field and
the `email` parameter have the same name, we only need to write `email` rather
than `email: email`.

### Creating Instances with Struct Update Syntax

It’s often useful to create a new instance of a struct that includes most of
the values from another instance of the same type, but changes some of them.
You can do this using struct update syntax.

First, in Listing 5-6 we show how to create a new `User` instance in `user2`
in the regular way, without the update syntax. We set a new value for `email`
but otherwise use the same values from `user1` that we created in Listing 5-2.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        // --snip--
    
        let user1 = User {
            email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
            username: String::from("someusername123"),
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        };
    
        let user2 = User {
            active: user1.active,
            username: user1.username,
            email: String::from("another@example.com"),
            sign_in_count: user1.sign_in_count,
        };
    }

Listing 5-6: Creating a new `User` instance using all but one of the values
from `user1`

Using struct update syntax, we can achieve the same effect with less code, as
shown in Listing 5-7. The syntax `..` specifies that the remaining fields not
explicitly set should have the same value as the fields in the given instance.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: String,
        email: String,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        // --snip--
    
        let user1 = User {
            email: String::from("someone@example.com"),
            username: String::from("someusername123"),
            active: true,
            sign_in_count: 1,
        };
    
        let user2 = User {
            email: String::from("another@example.com"),
            ..user1
        };
    }

Listing 5-7: Using struct update syntax to set a new `email` value for a
`User` instance but to use the rest of the values from `user1`

The code in Listing 5-7 also creates an instance in `user2` that has a
different value for `email` but has the same values for the `username`,
`active`, and `sign_in_count` fields from `user1`. The `..user1` must come
last to specify that any remaining fields should get their values from the
corresponding fields in `user1`, but we can choose to specify values for as
many fields as we want in any order, regardless of the order of the fields in
the struct’s definition.

Note that the struct update syntax uses `=` like an assignment; this is
because it moves the data, just as we saw in the “Variables and Data
Interacting with Move” section. In this example, we can no longer use `user1`
after creating `user2` because the `String` in the `username` field of `user1`
was moved into `user2`. If we had given `user2` new `String` values for both
`email` and `username`, and thus only used the `active` and `sign_in_count`
values from `user1`, then `user1` would still be valid after creating `user2`.
Both `active` and `sign_in_count` are types that implement the `Copy` trait,
so the behavior we discussed in the “Stack-Only Data: Copy” section would
apply. We can also still use `user1.email` in this example, because its value
was not moved out of `user1`.

### Creating Different Types with Tuple Structs

Rust also supports structs that look similar to tuples, called _tuple
structs_. Tuple structs have the added meaning the struct name provides but
don’t have names associated with their fields; rather, they just have the
types of the fields. Tuple structs are useful when you want to give the whole
tuple a name and make the tuple a different type from other tuples, and when
naming each field as in a regular struct would be verbose or redundant.

To define a tuple struct, start with the `struct` keyword and the struct name
followed by the types in the tuple. For example, here we define and use two
tuple structs named `Color` and `Point`:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Color(i32, i32, i32);
    struct Point(i32, i32, i32);
    
    fn main() {
        let black = Color(0, 0, 0);
        let origin = Point(0, 0, 0);
    }

Note that the `black` and `origin` values are different types because they’re
instances of different tuple structs. Each struct you define is its own type,
even though the fields within the struct might have the same types. For
example, a function that takes a parameter of type `Color` cannot take a
`Point` as an argument, even though both types are made up of three `i32`
values. Otherwise, tuple struct instances are similar to tuples in that you
can destructure them into their individual pieces, and you can use a `.`
followed by the index to access an individual value. Unlike tuples, tuple
structs require you to name the type of the struct when you destructure them.
For example, we would write `let Point(x, y, z) = origin;` to destructure the
values in the `origin` point into variables named `x`, `y`, and `z`.

### Defining Unit-Like Structs

You can also define structs that don’t have any fields! These are called
_unit-like structs_ because they behave similarly to `()`, the unit type that
we mentioned in “The Tuple Type” section. Unit-like structs can be useful when
you need to implement a trait on some type but don’t have any data that you
want to store in the type itself. We’ll discuss traits in Chapter 10. Here’s
an example of declaring and instantiating a unit struct named `AlwaysEqual`:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct AlwaysEqual;
    
    fn main() {
        let subject = AlwaysEqual;
    }

To define `AlwaysEqual`, we use the `struct` keyword, the name we want, and
then a semicolon. No need for curly brackets or parentheses! Then, we can get
an instance of `AlwaysEqual` in the `subject` variable in a similar way: using
the name we defined, without any curly brackets or parentheses. Imagine that
later we’ll implement behavior for this type such that every instance of
`AlwaysEqual` is always equal to every instance of any other type, perhaps to
have a known result for testing purposes. We wouldn’t need any data to
implement that behavior! You’ll see in Chapter 10 how to define traits and
implement them on any type, including unit-like structs.

### Ownership of Struct Data

In the `User` struct definition in Listing 5-1, we used the owned `String`
type rather than the `&str` string slice type. This is a deliberate choice
because we want each instance of this struct to own all of its data and for
that data to be valid for as long as the entire struct is valid.

It’s also possible for structs to store references to data owned by something
else, but to do so requires the use of _lifetimes_ , a Rust feature that we’ll
discuss in Chapter 10. Lifetimes ensure that the data referenced by a struct
is valid for as long as the struct is. Let’s say you try to store a reference
in a struct without specifying lifetimes, like the following in _src/main.rs_
; this won’t work:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct User {
        active: bool,
        username: &str,
        email: &str,
        sign_in_count: u64,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let user1 = User {
            active: true,
            username: "someusername123",
            email: "someone@example.com",
            sign_in_count: 1,
        };
    }

The compiler will complain that it needs lifetime specifiers:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling structs v0.1.0 (file:///projects/structs)
    error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
     --> src/main.rs:3:15
      |

      |               ^ expected named lifetime parameter
      |
    help: consider introducing a named lifetime parameter
      |
    1 ~ struct User<'a> {
    2 |     active: bool,
    3 ~     username: &'a str,
      |
    
    error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
     --> src/main.rs:4:12
      |
    4 |     email: &str,

    3 |     username: &str,
    4 ~     email: &'a str,
      |
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0106`.
    error: could not compile `structs` (bin "structs") due to 2 previous errors
    

In Chapter 10, we’ll discuss how to fix these errors so that you can store
references in structs, but for now, we’ll fix errors like these using owned
types like `String` instead of references like `&str`.

# An Example Program Using Structs

## An Example Program Using Structs

To understand when we might want to use structs, let’s write a program that
calculates the area of a rectangle. We’ll start by using single variables and
then refactor the program until we’re using structs instead.

Let’s make a new binary project with Cargo called _rectangles_ that will take
the width and height of a rectangle specified in pixels and calculate the area
of the rectangle. Listing 5-8 shows a short program with one way of doing
exactly that in our project’s _src/main.rs_.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let width1 = 30;
        let height1 = 50;
    
        println!(
            "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
            area(width1, height1)
        );
    }
    
    fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
        width * height
    }

Listing 5-8: Calculating the area of a rectangle specified by separate width
and height variables

Now, run this program using `cargo run`:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.42s
         Running `target/debug/rectangles`
    The area of the rectangle is 1500 square pixels.
    

This code succeeds in figuring out the area of the rectangle by calling the
`area` function with each dimension, but we can do more to make this code
clear and readable.

The issue with this code is evident in the signature of `area`:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let width1 = 30;
        let height1 = 50;
    
        println!(
            "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
            area(width1, height1)
        );
    }
    
    fn area(width: u32, height: u32) -> u32 {
        width * height
    }

The `area` function is supposed to calculate the area of one rectangle, but
the function we wrote has two parameters, and it’s not clear anywhere in our
program that the parameters are related. It would be more readable and more
manageable to group width and height together. We’ve already discussed one way
we might do that in “The Tuple Type” section of Chapter 3: by using tuples.

### Refactoring with Tuples

Listing 5-9 shows another version of our program that uses tuples.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = (30, 50);
    
        println!(
            "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
            area(rect1)
        );
    }
    
    fn area(dimensions: (u32, u32)) -> u32 {
        dimensions.0 * dimensions.1
    }

Listing 5-9: Specifying the width and height of the rectangle with a tuple

In one way, this program is better. Tuples let us add a bit of structure, and
we’re now passing just one argument. But in another way, this version is less
clear: Tuples don’t name their elements, so we have to index into the parts of
the tuple, making our calculation less obvious.

Mixing up the width and height wouldn’t matter for the area calculation, but
if we want to draw the rectangle on the screen, it would matter! We would have
to keep in mind that `width` is the tuple index `0` and `height` is the tuple
index `1`. This would be even harder for someone else to figure out and keep
in mind if they were to use our code. Because we haven’t conveyed the meaning
of our data in our code, it’s now easier to introduce errors.

### Refactoring with Structs

We use structs to add meaning by labeling the data. We can transform the tuple
we’re using into a struct with a name for the whole as well as names for the
parts, as shown in Listing 5-10.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
    
        println!(
            "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
            area(&rect1)
        );
    }
    
    fn area(rectangle: &Rectangle) -> u32 {
        rectangle.width * rectangle.height
    }

Listing 5-10: Defining a `Rectangle` struct

Here, we’ve defined a struct and named it `Rectangle`. Inside the curly
brackets, we defined the fields as `width` and `height`, both of which have
type `u32`. Then, in `main`, we created a particular instance of `Rectangle`
that has a width of `30` and a height of `50`.

Our `area` function is now defined with one parameter, which we’ve named
`rectangle`, whose type is an immutable borrow of a struct `Rectangle`
instance. As mentioned in Chapter 4, we want to borrow the struct rather than
take ownership of it. This way, `main` retains its ownership and can continue
using `rect1`, which is the reason we use the `&` in the function signature
and where we call the function.

The `area` function accesses the `width` and `height` fields of the
`Rectangle` instance (note that accessing fields of a borrowed struct instance
does not move the field values, which is why you often see borrows of
structs). Our function signature for `area` now says exactly what we mean:
Calculate the area of `Rectangle`, using its `width` and `height` fields. This
conveys that the width and height are related to each other, and it gives
descriptive names to the values rather than using the tuple index values of
`0` and `1`. This is a win for clarity.

### Adding Functionality with Derived Traits

It’d be useful to be able to print an instance of `Rectangle` while we’re
debugging our program and see the values for all its fields. Listing 5-11
tries using the [`println!` macro](../std/macro.println.html) as we have used
in previous chapters. This won’t work, however.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
    
        println!("rect1 is {rect1}");
    }

Listing 5-11: Attempting to print a `Rectangle` instance

When we compile this code, we get an error with this core message:

    
    
    error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `std::fmt::Display`
    

The `println!` macro can do many kinds of formatting, and by default, the
curly brackets tell `println!` to use formatting known as `Display`: output
intended for direct end user consumption. The primitive types we’ve seen so
far implement `Display` by default because there’s only one way you’d want to
show a `1` or any other primitive type to a user. But with structs, the way
`println!` should format the output is less clear because there are more
display possibilities: Do you want commas or not? Do you want to print the
curly brackets? Should all the fields be shown? Due to this ambiguity, Rust
doesn’t try to guess what we want, and structs don’t have a provided
implementation of `Display` to use with `println!` and the `{}` placeholder.

If we continue reading the errors, we’ll find this helpful note:

    
    
       |                        |`Rectangle` cannot be formatted with the default formatter
       |                        required by this formatting parameter
    

Let’s try it! The `println!` macro call will now look like `println!("rect1 is
{rect1:?}");`. Putting the specifier `:?` inside the curly brackets tells
`println!` we want to use an output format called `Debug`. The `Debug` trait
enables us to print our struct in a way that is useful for developers so that
we can see its value while we’re debugging our code.

Compile the code with this change. Drat! We still get an error:

    
    
    error[E0277]: `Rectangle` doesn't implement `Debug`
    

But again, the compiler gives us a helpful note:

    
    
       |                        required by this formatting parameter
       |
    

Rust _does_ include functionality to print out debugging information, but we
have to explicitly opt in to make that functionality available for our struct.
To do that, we add the outer attribute `#[derive(Debug)]` just before the
struct definition, as shown in Listing 5-12.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
    
        println!("rect1 is {rect1:?}");
    }

Listing 5-12: Adding the attribute to derive the `Debug` trait and printing
the `Rectangle` instance using debug formatting

Now when we run the program, we won’t get any errors, and we’ll see the
following output:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
         Running `target/debug/rectangles`
    rect1 is Rectangle { width: 30, height: 50 }
    

Nice! It’s not the prettiest output, but it shows the values of all the fields
for this instance, which would definitely help during debugging. When we have
larger structs, it’s useful to have output that’s a bit easier to read; in
those cases, we can use `{:#?}` instead of `{:?}` in the `println!` string. In
this example, using the `{:#?}` style will output the following:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.48s
         Running `target/debug/rectangles`
    rect1 is Rectangle {
        width: 30,
        height: 50,
    }
    

Another way to print out a value using the `Debug` format is to use the
[`dbg!` macro](../std/macro.dbg.html), which takes ownership of an expression
(as opposed to `println!`, which takes a reference), prints the file and line
number of where that `dbg!` macro call occurs in your code along with the
resultant value of that expression, and returns ownership of the value.

Note: Calling the `dbg!` macro prints to the standard error console stream
(`stderr`), as opposed to `println!`, which prints to the standard output
console stream (`stdout`). We’ll talk more about `stderr` and `stdout` in the
“Redirecting Errors to Standard Error” section in Chapter 12.

Here’s an example where we’re interested in the value that gets assigned to
the `width` field, as well as the value of the whole struct in `rect1`:

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let scale = 2;
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: dbg!(30 * scale),
            height: 50,
        };
    
        dbg!(&rect1);
    }

We can put `dbg!` around the expression `30 * scale` and, because `dbg!`
returns ownership of the expression’s value, the `width` field will get the
same value as if we didn’t have the `dbg!` call there. We don’t want `dbg!` to
take ownership of `rect1`, so we use a reference to `rect1` in the next call.
Here’s what the output of this example looks like:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling rectangles v0.1.0 (file:///projects/rectangles)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.61s
         Running `target/debug/rectangles`
    [src/main.rs:10:16] 30 * scale = 60
    [src/main.rs:14:5] &rect1 = Rectangle {
        width: 60,
        height: 50,
    }
    

We can see the first bit of output came from _src/main.rs_ line 10 where we’re
debugging the expression `30 * scale`, and its resultant value is `60` (the
`Debug` formatting implemented for integers is to print only their value). The
`dbg!` call on line 14 of _src/main.rs_ outputs the value of `&rect1`, which
is the `Rectangle` struct. This output uses the pretty `Debug` formatting of
the `Rectangle` type. The `dbg!` macro can be really helpful when you’re
trying to figure out what your code is doing!

In addition to the `Debug` trait, Rust has provided a number of traits for us
to use with the `derive` attribute that can add useful behavior to our custom
types. Those traits and their behaviors are listed in Appendix C. We’ll cover
how to implement these traits with custom behavior as well as how to create
your own traits in Chapter 10. There are also many attributes other than
`derive`; for more information, see [the “Attributes” section of the Rust
Reference](../reference/attributes.html).

Our `area` function is very specific: It only computes the area of rectangles.
It would be helpful to tie this behavior more closely to our `Rectangle`
struct because it won’t work with any other type. Let’s look at how we can
continue to refactor this code by turning the `area` function into an `area`
method defined on our `Rectangle` type.

# Methods

## Methods

Methods are similar to functions: We declare them with the `fn` keyword and a
name, they can have parameters and a return value, and they contain some code
that’s run when the method is called from somewhere else. Unlike functions,
methods are defined within the context of a struct (or an enum or a trait
object, which we cover in Chapter 6 and Chapter 18, respectively), and their
first parameter is always `self`, which represents the instance of the struct
the method is being called on.

### Method Syntax

Let’s change the `area` function that has a `Rectangle` instance as a
parameter and instead make an `area` method defined on the `Rectangle` struct,
as shown in Listing 5-13.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    impl Rectangle {
        fn area(&self) -> u32 {
            self.width * self.height
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
    
        println!(
            "The area of the rectangle is {} square pixels.",
            rect1.area()
        );
    }

Listing 5-13: Defining an `area` method on the `Rectangle` struct

To define the function within the context of `Rectangle`, we start an `impl`
(implementation) block for `Rectangle`. Everything within this `impl` block
will be associated with the `Rectangle` type. Then, we move the `area`
function within the `impl` curly brackets and change the first (and in this
case, only) parameter to be `self` in the signature and everywhere within the
body. In `main`, where we called the `area` function and passed `rect1` as an
argument, we can instead use _method syntax_ to call the `area` method on our
`Rectangle` instance. The method syntax goes after an instance: We add a dot
followed by the method name, parentheses, and any arguments.

In the signature for `area`, we use `&self` instead of `rectangle:
&Rectangle`. The `&self` is actually short for `self: &Self`. Within an `impl`
block, the type `Self` is an alias for the type that the `impl` block is for.
Methods must have a parameter named `self` of type `Self` for their first
parameter, so Rust lets you abbreviate this with only the name `self` in the
first parameter spot. Note that we still need to use the `&` in front of the
`self` shorthand to indicate that this method borrows the `Self` instance,
just as we did in `rectangle: &Rectangle`. Methods can take ownership of
`self`, borrow `self` immutably, as we’ve done here, or borrow `self` mutably,
just as they can any other parameter.

We chose `&self` here for the same reason we used `&Rectangle` in the function
version: We don’t want to take ownership, and we just want to read the data in
the struct, not write to it. If we wanted to change the instance that we’ve
called the method on as part of what the method does, we’d use `&mut self` as
the first parameter. Having a method that takes ownership of the instance by
using just `self` as the first parameter is rare; this technique is usually
used when the method transforms `self` into something else and you want to
prevent the caller from using the original instance after the transformation.

The main reason for using methods instead of functions, in addition to
providing method syntax and not having to repeat the type of `self` in every
method’s signature, is for organization. We’ve put all the things we can do
with an instance of a type in one `impl` block rather than making future users
of our code search for capabilities of `Rectangle` in various places in the
library we provide.

Note that we can choose to give a method the same name as one of the struct’s
fields. For example, we can define a method on `Rectangle` that is also named
`width`:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    impl Rectangle {
        fn width(&self) -> bool {
            self.width > 0
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
    
        if rect1.width() {
            println!("The rectangle has a nonzero width; it is {}", rect1.width);
        }
    }

Here, we’re choosing to make the `width` method return `true` if the value in
the instance’s `width` field is greater than `0` and `false` if the value is
`0`: We can use a field within a method of the same name for any purpose. In
`main`, when we follow `rect1.width` with parentheses, Rust knows we mean the
method `width`. When we don’t use parentheses, Rust knows we mean the field
`width`.

Often, but not always, when we give a method the same name as a field we want
it to only return the value in the field and do nothing else. Methods like
this are called _getters_ , and Rust does not implement them automatically for
struct fields as some other languages do. Getters are useful because you can
make the field private but the method public and thus enable read-only access
to that field as part of the type’s public API. We will discuss what public
and private are and how to designate a field or method as public or private in
Chapter 7.

### Where’s the `->` Operator?

In C and C++, two different operators are used for calling methods: You use
`.` if you’re calling a method on the object directly and `->` if you’re
calling the method on a pointer to the object and need to dereference the
pointer first. In other words, if `object` is a pointer, `object->something()`
is similar to `(*object).something()`.

Rust doesn’t have an equivalent to the `->` operator; instead, Rust has a
feature called _automatic referencing and dereferencing_. Calling methods is
one of the few places in Rust with this behavior.

Here’s how it works: When you call a method with `object.something()`, Rust
automatically adds in `&`, `&mut`, or `*` so that `object` matches the
signature of the method. In other words, the following are the same:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    #[derive(Debug,Copy,Clone)]
    struct Point {
        x: f64,
        y: f64,
    }
    
    impl Point {
       fn distance(&self, other: &Point) -> f64 {
           let x_squared = f64::powi(other.x - self.x, 2);
           let y_squared = f64::powi(other.y - self.y, 2);
    
           f64::sqrt(x_squared + y_squared)
       }
    }
    let p1 = Point { x: 0.0, y: 0.0 };
    let p2 = Point { x: 5.0, y: 6.5 };
    p1.distance(&p2);
    (&p1).distance(&p2);
    }

The first one looks much cleaner. This automatic referencing behavior works
because methods have a clear receiver—the type of `self`. Given the receiver
and name of a method, Rust can figure out definitively whether the method is
reading (`&self`), mutating (`&mut self`), or consuming (`self`). The fact
that Rust makes borrowing implicit for method receivers is a big part of
making ownership ergonomic in practice.

### Methods with More Parameters

Let’s practice using methods by implementing a second method on the
`Rectangle` struct. This time we want an instance of `Rectangle` to take
another instance of `Rectangle` and return `true` if the second `Rectangle`
can fit completely within `self` (the first `Rectangle`); otherwise, it should
return `false`. That is, once we’ve defined the `can_hold` method, we want to
be able to write the program shown in Listing 5-14.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
        let rect2 = Rectangle {
            width: 10,
            height: 40,
        };
        let rect3 = Rectangle {
            width: 60,
            height: 45,
        };
    
        println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
        println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
    }

Listing 5-14: Using the as-yet-unwritten `can_hold` method

The expected output would look like the following because both dimensions of
`rect2` are smaller than the dimensions of `rect1`, but `rect3` is wider than
`rect1`:

    
    
    Can rect1 hold rect2? true
    Can rect1 hold rect3? false
    

We know we want to define a method, so it will be within the `impl Rectangle`
block. The method name will be `can_hold`, and it will take an immutable
borrow of another `Rectangle` as a parameter. We can tell what the type of the
parameter will be by looking at the code that calls the method:
`rect1.can_hold(&rect2)` passes in `&rect2`, which is an immutable borrow to
`rect2`, an instance of `Rectangle`. This makes sense because we only need to
read `rect2` (rather than write, which would mean we’d need a mutable borrow),
and we want `main` to retain ownership of `rect2` so that we can use it again
after calling the `can_hold` method. The return value of `can_hold` will be a
Boolean, and the implementation will check whether the width and height of
`self` are greater than the width and height of the other `Rectangle`,
respectively. Let’s add the new `can_hold` method to the `impl` block from
Listing 5-13, shown in Listing 5-15.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    impl Rectangle {
        fn area(&self) -> u32 {
            self.width * self.height
        }
    
        fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
            self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
        let rect2 = Rectangle {
            width: 10,
            height: 40,
        };
        let rect3 = Rectangle {
            width: 60,
            height: 45,
        };
    
        println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
        println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
    }

Listing 5-15: Implementing the `can_hold` method on `Rectangle` that takes
another `Rectangle` instance as a parameter

When we run this code with the `main` function in Listing 5-14, we’ll get our
desired output. Methods can take multiple parameters that we add to the
signature after the `self` parameter, and those parameters work just like
parameters in functions.

### Associated Functions

All functions defined within an `impl` block are called _associated functions_
because they’re associated with the type named after the `impl`. We can define
associated functions that don’t have `self` as their first parameter (and thus
are not methods) because they don’t need an instance of the type to work with.
We’ve already used one function like this: the `String::from` function that’s
defined on the `String` type.

Associated functions that aren’t methods are often used for constructors that
will return a new instance of the struct. These are often called `new`, but
`new` isn’t a special name and isn’t built into the language. For example, we
could choose to provide an associated function named `square` that would have
one dimension parameter and use that as both width and height, thus making it
easier to create a square `Rectangle` rather than having to specify the same
value twice:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    impl Rectangle {
        fn square(size: u32) -> Self {
            Self {
                width: size,
                height: size,
            }
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let sq = Rectangle::square(3);
    }

The `Self` keywords in the return type and in the body of the function are
aliases for the type that appears after the `impl` keyword, which in this case
is `Rectangle`.

To call this associated function, we use the `::` syntax with the struct name;
`let sq = Rectangle::square(3);` is an example. This function is namespaced by
the struct: The `::` syntax is used for both associated functions and
namespaces created by modules. We’ll discuss modules in Chapter 7.

### Multiple `impl` Blocks

Each struct is allowed to have multiple `impl` blocks. For example, Listing
5-15 is equivalent to the code shown in Listing 5-16, which has each method in
its own `impl` block.

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    struct Rectangle {
        width: u32,
        height: u32,
    }
    
    impl Rectangle {
        fn area(&self) -> u32 {
            self.width * self.height
        }
    }
    
    impl Rectangle {
        fn can_hold(&self, other: &Rectangle) -> bool {
            self.width > other.width && self.height > other.height
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let rect1 = Rectangle {
            width: 30,
            height: 50,
        };
        let rect2 = Rectangle {
            width: 10,
            height: 40,
        };
        let rect3 = Rectangle {
            width: 60,
            height: 45,
        };
    
        println!("Can rect1 hold rect2? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect2));
        println!("Can rect1 hold rect3? {}", rect1.can_hold(&rect3));
    }

Listing 5-16: Rewriting Listing 5-15 using multiple `impl` blocks

There’s no reason to separate these methods into multiple `impl` blocks here,
but this is valid syntax. We’ll see a case in which multiple `impl` blocks are
useful in Chapter 10, where we discuss generic types and traits.

## Summary

Structs let you create custom types that are meaningful for your domain. By
using structs, you can keep associated pieces of data connected to each other
and name each piece to make your code clear. In `impl` blocks, you can define
functions that are associated with your type, and methods are a kind of
associated function that let you specify the behavior that instances of your
structs have.

But structs aren’t the only way you can create custom types: Let’s turn to
Rust’s enum feature to add another tool to your toolbox.

# Enums and Pattern Matching

In this chapter, we’ll look at enumerations, also referred to as _enums_.
Enums allow you to define a type by enumerating its possible variants. First
we’ll define and use an enum to show how an enum can encode meaning along with
data. Next, we’ll explore a particularly useful enum, called `Option`, which
expresses that a value can be either something or nothing. Then, we’ll look at
how pattern matching in the `match` expression makes it easy to run different
code for different values of an enum. Finally, we’ll cover how the `if let`
construct is another convenient and concise idiom available to handle enums in
your code.

# Defining an Enum

## Defining an Enum

Where structs give you a way of grouping together related fields and data,
like a `Rectangle` with its `width` and `height`, enums give you a way of
saying a value is one of a possible set of values. For example, we may want to
say that `Rectangle` is one of a set of possible shapes that also includes
`Circle` and `Triangle`. To do this, Rust allows us to encode these
possibilities as an enum.

Let’s look at a situation we might want to express in code and see why enums
are useful and more appropriate than structs in this case. Say we need to work
with IP addresses. Currently, two major standards are used for IP addresses:
version four and version six. Because these are the only possibilities for an
IP address that our program will come across, we can _enumerate_ all possible
variants, which is where enumeration gets its name.

Any IP address can be either a version four or a version six address, but not
both at the same time. That property of IP addresses makes the enum data
structure appropriate because an enum value can only be one of its variants.
Both version four and version six addresses are still fundamentally IP
addresses, so they should be treated as the same type when the code is
handling situations that apply to any kind of IP address.

We can express this concept in code by defining an `IpAddrKind` enumeration
and listing the possible kinds an IP address can be, `V4` and `V6`. These are
the variants of the enum:

    
    
    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
        let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
    
        route(IpAddrKind::V4);
        route(IpAddrKind::V6);
    }
    
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

`IpAddrKind` is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

### Enum Values

We can create instances of each of the two variants of `IpAddrKind` like this:

    
    
    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
        let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
    
        route(IpAddrKind::V4);
        route(IpAddrKind::V6);
    }
    
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

Note that the variants of the enum are namespaced under its identifier, and we
use a double colon to separate the two. This is useful because now both values
`IpAddrKind::V4` and `IpAddrKind::V6` are of the same type: `IpAddrKind`. We
can then, for instance, define a function that takes any `IpAddrKind`:

    
    
    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
        let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
    
        route(IpAddrKind::V4);
        route(IpAddrKind::V6);
    }
    
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

And we can call this function with either variant:

    
    
    enum IpAddrKind {
        V4,
        V6,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
        let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
    
        route(IpAddrKind::V4);
        route(IpAddrKind::V6);
    }
    
    fn route(ip_kind: IpAddrKind) {}

Using enums has even more advantages. Thinking more about our IP address type,
at the moment we don’t have a way to store the actual IP address _data_ ; we
only know what _kind_ it is. Given that you just learned about structs in
Chapter 5, you might be tempted to tackle this problem with structs as shown
in Listing 6-1.

    
    
    fn main() {
        enum IpAddrKind {
            V4,
            V6,
        }
    
        struct IpAddr {
            kind: IpAddrKind,
            address: String,
        }
    
        let home = IpAddr {
            kind: IpAddrKind::V4,
            address: String::from("127.0.0.1"),
        };
    
        let loopback = IpAddr {
            kind: IpAddrKind::V6,
            address: String::from("::1"),
        };
    }

Listing 6-1: Storing the data and `IpAddrKind` variant of an IP address using
a `struct`

Here, we’ve defined a struct `IpAddr` that has two fields: a `kind` field that
is of type `IpAddrKind` (the enum we defined previously) and an `address`
field of type `String`. We have two instances of this struct. The first is
`home`, and it has the value `IpAddrKind::V4` as its `kind` with associated
address data of `127.0.0.1`. The second instance is `loopback`. It has the
other variant of `IpAddrKind` as its `kind` value, `V6`, and has address `::1`
associated with it. We’ve used a struct to bundle the `kind` and `address`
values together, so now the variant is associated with the value.

However, representing the same concept using just an enum is more concise:
Rather than an enum inside a struct, we can put data directly into each enum
variant. This new definition of the `IpAddr` enum says that both `V4` and `V6`
variants will have associated `String` values:

    
    
    fn main() {
        enum IpAddr {
            V4(String),
            V6(String),
        }
    
        let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
    
        let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
    }

We attach data to each variant of the enum directly, so there is no need for
an extra struct. Here, it’s also easier to see another detail of how enums
work: The name of each enum variant that we define also becomes a function
that constructs an instance of the enum. That is, `IpAddr::V4()` is a function
call that takes a `String` argument and returns an instance of the `IpAddr`
type. We automatically get this constructor function defined as a result of
defining the enum.

There’s another advantage to using an enum rather than a struct: Each variant
can have different types and amounts of associated data. Version four IP
addresses will always have four numeric components that will have values
between 0 and 255. If we wanted to store `V4` addresses as four `u8` values
but still express `V6` addresses as one `String` value, we wouldn’t be able to
with a struct. Enums handle this case with ease:

    
    
    fn main() {
        enum IpAddr {
            V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
            V6(String),
        }
    
        let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);
    
        let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
    }

We’ve shown several different ways to define data structures to store version
four and version six IP addresses. However, as it turns out, wanting to store
IP addresses and encode which kind they are is so common that [the standard
library has a definition we can use!](../std/net/enum.IpAddr.html) Let’s look
at how the standard library defines `IpAddr`. It has the exact enum and
variants that we’ve defined and used, but it embeds the address data inside
the variants in the form of two different structs, which are defined
differently for each variant:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    struct Ipv4Addr {
        // --snip--
    }
    
    struct Ipv6Addr {
        // --snip--
    }
    
    enum IpAddr {
        V4(Ipv4Addr),
        V6(Ipv6Addr),
    }
    }

This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum
variant: strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include
another enum! Also, standard library types are often not much more complicated
than what you might come up with.

Note that even though the standard library contains a definition for `IpAddr`,
we can still create and use our own definition without conflict because we
haven’t brought the standard library’s definition into our scope. We’ll talk
more about bringing types into scope in Chapter 7.

Let’s look at another example of an enum in Listing 6-2: This one has a wide
variety of types embedded in its variants.

    
    
    enum Message {
        Quit,
        Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
        Write(String),
        ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
    }
    
    fn main() {}

Listing 6-2: A `Message` enum whose variants each store different amounts and
types of values

This enum has four variants with different types:

  * `Quit`: Has no data associated with it at all
  * `Move`: Has named fields, like a struct does
  * `Write`: Includes a single `String`
  * `ChangeColor`: Includes three `i32` values

Defining an enum with variants such as the ones in Listing 6-2 is similar to
defining different kinds of struct definitions, except the enum doesn’t use
the `struct` keyword and all the variants are grouped together under the
`Message` type. The following structs could hold the same data that the
preceding enum variants hold:

    
    
    struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
    struct MoveMessage {
        x: i32,
        y: i32,
    }
    struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
    struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
    
    fn main() {}

But if we used the different structs, each of which has its own type, we
couldn’t as easily define a function to take any of these kinds of messages as
we could with the `Message` enum defined in Listing 6-2, which is a single
type.

There is one more similarity between enums and structs: Just as we’re able to
define methods on structs using `impl`, we’re also able to define methods on
enums. Here’s a method named `call` that we could define on our `Message`
enum:

    
    
    fn main() {
        enum Message {
            Quit,
            Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
            Write(String),
            ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
        }
    
        impl Message {
            fn call(&self) {
                // method body would be defined here
            }
        }
    
        let m = Message::Write(String::from("hello"));
        m.call();
    }

The body of the method would use `self` to get the value that we called the
method on. In this example, we’ve created a variable `m` that has the value
`Message::Write(String::from("hello"))`, and that is what `self` will be in
the body of the `call` method when `m.call()` runs.

Let’s look at another enum in the standard library that is very common and
useful: `Option`.

### The `Option` Enum

This section explores a case study of `Option`, which is another enum defined
by the standard library. The `Option` type encodes the very common scenario in
which a value could be something, or it could be nothing.

For example, if you request the first item in a non-empty list, you would get
a value. If you request the first item in an empty list, you would get
nothing. Expressing this concept in terms of the type system means the
compiler can check whether you’ve handled all the cases you should be
handling; this functionality can prevent bugs that are extremely common in
other programming languages.

Programming language design is often thought of in terms of which features you
include, but the features you exclude are important too. Rust doesn’t have the
null feature that many other languages have. _Null_ is a value that means
there is no value there. In languages with null, variables can always be in
one of two states: null or not-null.

In his 2009 presentation “Null References: The Billion Dollar Mistake,” Tony
Hoare, the inventor of null, had this to say:

> I call it my billion-dollar mistake. At that time, I was designing the first
> comprehensive type system for references in an object-oriented language. My
> goal was to ensure that all use of references should be absolutely safe,
> with checking performed automatically by the compiler. But I couldn’t resist
> the temptation to put in a null reference, simply because it was so easy to
> implement. This has led to innumerable errors, vulnerabilities, and system
> crashes, which have probably caused a billion dollars of pain and damage in
> the last forty years.

The problem with null values is that if you try to use a null value as a not-
null value, you’ll get an error of some kind. Because this null or not-null
property is pervasive, it’s extremely easy to make this kind of error.

However, the concept that null is trying to express is still a useful one: A
null is a value that is currently invalid or absent for some reason.

The problem isn’t really with the concept but with the particular
implementation. As such, Rust does not have nulls, but it does have an enum
that can encode the concept of a value being present or absent. This enum is
`Option<T>`, and it is [defined by the standard
library](../std/option/enum.Option.html) as follows:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    enum Option<T> {
        None,
        Some(T),
    }
    }

The `Option<T>` enum is so useful that it’s even included in the prelude; you
don’t need to bring it into scope explicitly. Its variants are also included
in the prelude: You can use `Some` and `None` directly without the `Option::`
prefix. The `Option<T>` enum is still just a regular enum, and `Some(T)` and
`None` are still variants of type `Option<T>`.

The `<T>` syntax is a feature of Rust we haven’t talked about yet. It’s a
generic type parameter, and we’ll cover generics in more detail in Chapter 10.
For now, all you need to know is that `<T>` means that the `Some` variant of
the `Option` enum can hold one piece of data of any type, and that each
concrete type that gets used in place of `T` makes the overall `Option<T>`
type a different type. Here are some examples of using `Option` values to hold
number types and char types:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let some_number = Some(5);
        let some_char = Some('e');
    
        let absent_number: Option<i32> = None;
    }

The type of `some_number` is `Option<i32>`. The type of `some_char` is
`Option<char>`, which is a different type. Rust can infer these types because
we’ve specified a value inside the `Some` variant. For `absent_number`, Rust
requires us to annotate the overall `Option` type: The compiler can’t infer
the type that the corresponding `Some` variant will hold by looking only at a
`None` value. Here, we tell Rust that we mean for `absent_number` to be of
type `Option<i32>`.

When we have a `Some` value, we know that a value is present, and the value is
held within the `Some`. When we have a `None` value, in some sense it means
the same thing as null: We don’t have a valid value. So, why is having
`Option<T>` any better than having null?

In short, because `Option<T>` and `T` (where `T` can be any type) are
different types, the compiler won’t let us use an `Option<T>` value as if it
were definitely a valid value. For example, this code won’t compile, because
it’s trying to add an `i8` to an `Option<i8>`:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x: i8 = 5;
        let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);
    
        let sum = x + y;
    }

If we run this code, we get an error message like this one:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling enums v0.1.0 (file:///projects/enums)
    error[E0277]: cannot add `Option<i8>` to `i8`
     --> src/main.rs:5:17
      |
    5 |     let sum = x + y;
      |                 ^ no implementation for `i8 + Option<i8>`
      |
      = help: the trait `Add<Option<i8>>` is not implemented for `i8`
      = help: the following other types implement trait `Add<Rhs>`:
                `&i8` implements `Add<i8>`
                `&i8` implements `Add`
                `i8` implements `Add<&i8>`
                `i8` implements `Add`
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
    error: could not compile `enums` (bin "enums") due to 1 previous error
    

Intense! In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t understand how
to add an `i8` and an `Option<i8>`, because they’re different types. When we
have a value of a type like `i8` in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we
always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check
for null before using that value. Only when we have an `Option<i8>` (or
whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly
not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before
using the value.

In other words, you have to convert an `Option<T>` to a `T` before you can
perform `T` operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most
common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually
is.

Eliminating the risk of incorrectly assuming a not-null value helps you be
more confident in your code. In order to have a value that can possibly be
null, you must explicitly opt in by making the type of that value `Option<T>`.
Then, when you use that value, you are required to explicitly handle the case
when the value is null. Everywhere that a value has a type that isn’t an
`Option<T>`, you _can_ safely assume that the value isn’t null. This was a
deliberate design decision for Rust to limit null’s pervasiveness and increase
the safety of Rust code.

So how do you get the `T` value out of a `Some` variant when you have a value
of type `Option<T>` so that you can use that value? The `Option<T>` enum has a
large number of methods that are useful in a variety of situations; you can
check them out in [its documentation](../std/option/enum.Option.html).
Becoming familiar with the methods on `Option<T>` will be extremely useful in
your journey with Rust.

In general, in order to use an `Option<T>` value, you want to have code that
will handle each variant. You want some code that will run only when you have
a `Some(T)` value, and this code is allowed to use the inner `T`. You want
some other code to run only if you have a `None` value, and that code doesn’t
have a `T` value available. The `match` expression is a control flow construct
that does just this when used with enums: It will run different code depending
on which variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the
matching value.

# The match Control Flow Construct

## The `match` Control Flow Construct

Rust has an extremely powerful control flow construct called `match` that
allows you to compare a value against a series of patterns and then execute
code based on which pattern matches. Patterns can be made up of literal
values, variable names, wildcards, and many other things; Chapter 19 covers
all the different kinds of patterns and what they do. The power of `match`
comes from the expressiveness of the patterns and the fact that the compiler
confirms that all possible cases are handled.

Think of a `match` expression as being like a coin-sorting machine: Coins
slide down a track with variously sized holes along it, and each coin falls
through the first hole it encounters that it fits into. In the same way,
values go through each pattern in a `match`, and at the first pattern the
value “fits,” the value falls into the associated code block to be used during
execution.

Speaking of coins, let’s use them as an example using `match`! We can write a
function that takes an unknown US coin and, in a similar way as the counting
machine, determines which coin it is and returns its value in cents, as shown
in Listing 6-3.

    
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter,
    }
    
    fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
        match coin {
            Coin::Penny => 1,
            Coin::Nickel => 5,
            Coin::Dime => 10,
            Coin::Quarter => 25,
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {}

Listing 6-3: An enum and a `match` expression that has the variants of the
enum as its patterns

Let’s break down the `match` in the `value_in_cents` function. First, we list
the `match` keyword followed by an expression, which in this case is the value
`coin`. This seems very similar to a conditional expression used with `if`,
but there’s a big difference: With `if`, the condition needs to evaluate to a
Boolean value, but here it can be any type. The type of `coin` in this example
is the `Coin` enum that we defined on the first line.

Next are the `match` arms. An arm has two parts: a pattern and some code. The
first arm here has a pattern that is the value `Coin::Penny` and then the `=>`
operator that separates the pattern and the code to run. The code in this case
is just the value `1`. Each arm is separated from the next with a comma.

When the `match` expression executes, it compares the resultant value against
the pattern of each arm, in order. If a pattern matches the value, the code
associated with that pattern is executed. If that pattern doesn’t match the
value, execution continues to the next arm, much as in a coin-sorting machine.
We can have as many arms as we need: In Listing 6-3, our `match` has four
arms.

The code associated with each arm is an expression, and the resultant value of
the expression in the matching arm is the value that gets returned for the
entire `match` expression.

We don’t typically use curly brackets if the match arm code is short, as it is
in Listing 6-3 where each arm just returns a value. If you want to run
multiple lines of code in a match arm, you must use curly brackets, and the
comma following the arm is then optional. For example, the following code
prints “Lucky penny!” every time the method is called with a `Coin::Penny`,
but it still returns the last value of the block, `1`:

    
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter,
    }
    
    fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
        match coin {
            Coin::Penny => {
                println!("Lucky penny!");
                1
            }
            Coin::Nickel => 5,
            Coin::Dime => 10,
            Coin::Quarter => 25,
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {}

### Patterns That Bind to Values

Another useful feature of match arms is that they can bind to the parts of the
values that match the pattern. This is how we can extract values out of enum
variants.

As an example, let’s change one of our enum variants to hold data inside it.
From 1999 through 2008, the United States minted quarters with different
designs for each of the 50 states on one side. No other coins got state
designs, so only quarters have this extra value. We can add this information
to our `enum` by changing the `Quarter` variant to include a `UsState` value
stored inside it, which we’ve done in Listing 6-4.

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn main() {}

Listing 6-4: A `Coin` enum in which the `Quarter` variant also holds a
`UsState` value

Let’s imagine that a friend is trying to collect all 50 state quarters. While
we sort our loose change by coin type, we’ll also call out the name of the
state associated with each quarter so that if it’s one our friend doesn’t
have, they can add it to their collection.

In the match expression for this code, we add a variable called `state` to the
pattern that matches values of the variant `Coin::Quarter`. When a
`Coin::Quarter` matches, the `state` variable will bind to the value of that
quarter’s state. Then, we can use `state` in the code for that arm, like so:

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
        match coin {
            Coin::Penny => 1,
            Coin::Nickel => 5,
            Coin::Dime => 10,
            Coin::Quarter(state) => {
                println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
                25
            }
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska));
    }

If we were to call `value_in_cents(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska))`, `coin`
would be `Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)`. When we compare that value with
each of the match arms, none of them match until we reach
`Coin::Quarter(state)`. At that point, the binding for `state` will be the
value `UsState::Alaska`. We can then use that binding in the `println!`
expression, thus getting the inner state value out of the `Coin` enum variant
for `Quarter`.

### The `Option<T>` `match` Pattern

In the previous section, we wanted to get the inner `T` value out of the
`Some` case when using `Option<T>`; we can also handle `Option<T>` using
`match`, as we did with the `Coin` enum! Instead of comparing coins, we’ll
compare the variants of `Option<T>`, but the way the `match` expression works
remains the same.

Let’s say we want to write a function that takes an `Option<i32>` and, if
there’s a value inside, adds 1 to that value. If there isn’t a value inside,
the function should return the `None` value and not attempt to perform any
operations.

This function is very easy to write, thanks to `match`, and will look like
Listing 6-5.

    
    
    fn main() {
        fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
            match x {
                None => None,
                Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
            }
        }
    
        let five = Some(5);
        let six = plus_one(five);
        let none = plus_one(None);
    }

Listing 6-5: A function that uses a `match` expression on an `Option<i32>`

Let’s examine the first execution of `plus_one` in more detail. When we call
`plus_one(five)`, the variable `x` in the body of `plus_one` will have the
value `Some(5)`. We then compare that against each match arm:

    
    
    fn main() {
        fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
            match x {
                None => None,
                Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
            }
        }
    
        let five = Some(5);
        let six = plus_one(five);
        let none = plus_one(None);
    }

The `Some(5)` value doesn’t match the pattern `None`, so we continue to the
next arm:

    
    
    fn main() {
        fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
            match x {
                None => None,
                Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
            }
        }
    
        let five = Some(5);
        let six = plus_one(five);
        let none = plus_one(None);
    }

Does `Some(5)` match `Some(i)`? It does! We have the same variant. The `i`
binds to the value contained in `Some`, so `i` takes the value `5`. The code
in the match arm is then executed, so we add 1 to the value of `i` and create
a new `Some` value with our total `6` inside.

Now let’s consider the second call of `plus_one` in Listing 6-5, where `x` is
`None`. We enter the `match` and compare to the first arm:

    
    
    fn main() {
        fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
            match x {
                None => None,
                Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
            }
        }
    
        let five = Some(5);
        let six = plus_one(five);
        let none = plus_one(None);
    }

It matches! There’s no value to add to, so the program stops and returns the
`None` value on the right side of `=>`. Because the first arm matched, no
other arms are compared.

Combining `match` and enums is useful in many situations. You’ll see this
pattern a lot in Rust code: `match` against an enum, bind a variable to the
data inside, and then execute code based on it. It’s a bit tricky at first,
but once you get used to it, you’ll wish you had it in all languages. It’s
consistently a user favorite.

### Matches Are Exhaustive

There’s one other aspect of `match` we need to discuss: The arms’ patterns
must cover all possibilities. Consider this version of our `plus_one`
function, which has a bug and won’t compile:

    
    
    fn main() {
        fn plus_one(x: Option<i32>) -> Option<i32> {
            match x {
                Some(i) => Some(i + 1),
            }
        }
    
        let five = Some(5);
        let six = plus_one(five);
        let none = plus_one(None);
    }

We didn’t handle the `None` case, so this code will cause a bug. Luckily, it’s
a bug Rust knows how to catch. If we try to compile this code, we’ll get this
error:

    
    
    $ cargo run

Rust knows that we didn’t cover every possible case and even knows which
pattern we forgot! Matches in Rust are _exhaustive_ : We must exhaust every
last possibility in order for the code to be valid. Especially in the case of
`Option<T>`, when Rust prevents us from forgetting to explicitly handle the
`None` case, it protects us from assuming that we have a value when we might
have null, thus making the billion-dollar mistake discussed earlier
impossible.

### Catch-All Patterns and the `_` Placeholder

Using enums, we can also take special actions for a few particular values, but
for all other values take one default action. Imagine we’re implementing a
game where, if you roll a 3 on a dice roll, your player doesn’t move but
instead gets a fancy new hat. If you roll a 7, your player loses a fancy hat.
For all other values, your player moves that number of spaces on the game
board. Here’s a `match` that implements that logic, with the result of the
dice roll hardcoded rather than a random value, and all other logic
represented by functions without bodies because actually implementing them is
out of scope for this example:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let dice_roll = 9;
        match dice_roll {
            3 => add_fancy_hat(),
            7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
            other => move_player(other),
        }
    
        fn add_fancy_hat() {}
        fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
        fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
    }

For the first two arms, the patterns are the literal values `3` and `7`. For
the last arm that covers every other possible value, the pattern is the
variable we’ve chosen to name `other`. The code that runs for the `other` arm
uses the variable by passing it to the `move_player` function.

This code compiles, even though we haven’t listed all the possible values a
`u8` can have, because the last pattern will match all values not specifically
listed. This catch-all pattern meets the requirement that `match` must be
exhaustive. Note that we have to put the catch-all arm last because the
patterns are evaluated in order. If we had put the catch-all arm earlier, the
other arms would never run, so Rust will warn us if we add arms after a catch-
all!

Rust also has a pattern we can use when we want a catch-all but don’t want to
_use_ the value in the catch-all pattern: `_` is a special pattern that
matches any value and does not bind to that value. This tells Rust we aren’t
going to use the value, so Rust won’t warn us about an unused variable.

Let’s change the rules of the game: Now, if you roll anything other than a 3
or a 7, you must roll again. We no longer need to use the catch-all value, so
we can change our code to use `_` instead of the variable named `other`:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let dice_roll = 9;
        match dice_roll {
            3 => add_fancy_hat(),
            7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
            _ => reroll(),
        }
    
        fn add_fancy_hat() {}
        fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
        fn reroll() {}
    }

This example also meets the exhaustiveness requirement because we’re
explicitly ignoring all other values in the last arm; we haven’t forgotten
anything.

Finally, we’ll change the rules of the game one more time so that nothing else
happens on your turn if you roll anything other than a 3 or a 7. We can
express that by using the unit value (the empty tuple type we mentioned in
“The Tuple Type” section) as the code that goes with the `_` arm:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let dice_roll = 9;
        match dice_roll {
            3 => add_fancy_hat(),
            7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
            _ => (),
        }
    
        fn add_fancy_hat() {}
        fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    }

Here, we’re telling Rust explicitly that we aren’t going to use any other
value that doesn’t match a pattern in an earlier arm, and we don’t want to run
any code in this case.

There’s more about patterns and matching that we’ll cover in Chapter 19. For
now, we’re going to move on to the `if let` syntax, which can be useful in
situations where the `match` expression is a bit wordy.

# Concise Control Flow with if let and let...else

## Concise Control Flow with `if let` and `let...else`

The `if let` syntax lets you combine `if` and `let` into a less verbose way to
handle values that match one pattern while ignoring the rest. Consider the
program in Listing 6-6 that matches on an `Option<u8>` value in the
`config_max` variable but only wants to execute code if the value is the
`Some` variant.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let config_max = Some(3u8);
        match config_max {
            Some(max) => println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}"),
            _ => (),
        }
    }

Listing 6-6: A `match` that only cares about executing code when the value is
`Some`

If the value is `Some`, we print out the value in the `Some` variant by
binding the value to the variable `max` in the pattern. We don’t want to do
anything with the `None` value. To satisfy the `match` expression, we have to
add `_ => ()` after processing just one variant, which is annoying boilerplate
code to add.

Instead, we could write this in a shorter way using `if let`. The following
code behaves the same as the `match` in Listing 6-6:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let config_max = Some(3u8);
        if let Some(max) = config_max {
            println!("The maximum is configured to be {max}");
        }
    }

The syntax `if let` takes a pattern and an expression separated by an equal
sign. It works the same way as a `match`, where the expression is given to the
`match` and the pattern is its first arm. In this case, the pattern is
`Some(max)`, and the `max` binds to the value inside the `Some`. We can then
use `max` in the body of the `if let` block in the same way we used `max` in
the corresponding `match` arm. The code in the `if let` block only runs if the
value matches the pattern.

Using `if let` means less typing, less indentation, and less boilerplate code.
However, you lose the exhaustive checking `match` enforces that ensures that
you aren’t forgetting to handle any cases. Choosing between `match` and `if
let` depends on what you’re doing in your particular situation and whether
gaining conciseness is an appropriate trade-off for losing exhaustive
checking.

In other words, you can think of `if let` as syntax sugar for a `match` that
runs code when the value matches one pattern and then ignores all other
values.

We can include an `else` with an `if let`. The block of code that goes with
the `else` is the same as the block of code that would go with the `_` case in
the `match` expression that is equivalent to the `if let` and `else`. Recall
the `Coin` enum definition in Listing 6-4, where the `Quarter` variant also
held a `UsState` value. If we wanted to count all non-quarter coins we see
while also announcing the state of the quarters, we could do that with a
`match` expression, like this:

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let coin = Coin::Penny;
        let mut count = 0;
        match coin {
            Coin::Quarter(state) => println!("State quarter from {state:?}!"),
            _ => count += 1,
        }
    }

Or we could use an `if let` and `else` expression, like this:

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let coin = Coin::Penny;
        let mut count = 0;
        if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
            println!("State quarter from {state:?}!");
        } else {
            count += 1;
        }
    }

## Staying on the “Happy Path” with `let...else`

The common pattern is to perform some computation when a value is present and
return a default value otherwise. Continuing with our example of coins with a
`UsState` value, if we wanted to say something funny depending on how old the
state on the quarter was, we might introduce a method on `UsState` to check
the age of a state, like so:

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    impl UsState {
        fn existed_in(&self, year: u16) -> bool {
            match self {
                UsState::Alabama => year >= 1819,
                UsState::Alaska => year >= 1959,
                // -- snip --
            }
        }
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
        if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
            if state.existed_in(1900) {
                Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
            } else {
                Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
            }
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        if let Some(desc) = describe_state_quarter(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)) {
            println!("{desc}");
        }
    }

Then, we might use `if let` to match on the type of coin, introducing a
`state` variable within the body of the condition, as in Listing 6-7.

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    impl UsState {
        fn existed_in(&self, year: u16) -> bool {
            match self {
                UsState::Alabama => year >= 1819,
                UsState::Alaska => year >= 1959,
                // -- snip --
            }
        }
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
        if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
            if state.existed_in(1900) {
                Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
            } else {
                Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
            }
        } else {
            None
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        if let Some(desc) = describe_state_quarter(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)) {
            println!("{desc}");
        }
    }

Listing 6-7: Checking whether a state existed in 1900 by using conditionals
nested inside an `if let`

That gets the job done, but it has pushed the work into the body of the `if
let` statement, and if the work to be done is more complicated, it might be
hard to follow exactly how the top-level branches relate. We could also take
advantage of the fact that expressions produce a value either to produce the
`state` from the `if let` or to return early, as in Listing 6-8. (You could do
something similar with a `match`, too.)

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    impl UsState {
        fn existed_in(&self, year: u16) -> bool {
            match self {
                UsState::Alabama => year >= 1819,
                UsState::Alaska => year >= 1959,
                // -- snip --
            }
        }
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
        let state = if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
            state
        } else {
            return None;
        };
    
        if state.existed_in(1900) {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
        } else {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        if let Some(desc) = describe_state_quarter(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)) {
            println!("{desc}");
        }
    }

Listing 6-8: Using `if let` to produce a value or return early

This is a bit annoying to follow in its own way, though! One branch of the `if
let` produces a value, and the other one returns from the function entirely.

To make this common pattern nicer to express, Rust has `let...else`. The
`let...else` syntax takes a pattern on the left side and an expression on the
right, very similar to `if let`, but it does not have an `if` branch, only an
`else` branch. If the pattern matches, it will bind the value from the pattern
in the outer scope. If the pattern does _not_ match, the program will flow
into the `else` arm, which must return from the function.

In Listing 6-9, you can see how Listing 6-8 looks when using `let...else` in
place of `if let`.

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)] // so we can inspect the state in a minute
    enum UsState {
        Alabama,
        Alaska,
        // --snip--
    }
    
    impl UsState {
        fn existed_in(&self, year: u16) -> bool {
            match self {
                UsState::Alabama => year >= 1819,
                UsState::Alaska => year >= 1959,
                // -- snip --
            }
        }
    }
    
    enum Coin {
        Penny,
        Nickel,
        Dime,
        Quarter(UsState),
    }
    
    fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
        let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin else {
            return None;
        };
    
        if state.existed_in(1900) {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
        } else {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        if let Some(desc) = describe_state_quarter(Coin::Quarter(UsState::Alaska)) {
            println!("{desc}");
        }
    }

Listing 6-9: Using `let...else` to clarify the flow through the function

Notice that it stays on the “happy path” in the main body of the function this
way, without having significantly different control flow for two branches the
way the `if let` did.

If you have a situation in which your program has logic that is too verbose to
express using a `match`, remember that `if let` and `let...else` are in your
Rust toolbox as well.

## Summary

We’ve now covered how to use enums to create custom types that can be one of a
set of enumerated values. We’ve shown how the standard library’s `Option<T>`
type helps you use the type system to prevent errors. When enum values have
data inside them, you can use `match` or `if let` to extract and use those
values, depending on how many cases you need to handle.

Your Rust programs can now express concepts in your domain using structs and
enums. Creating custom types to use in your API ensures type safety: The
compiler will make certain your functions only get values of the type each
function expects.

In order to provide a well-organized API to your users that is straightforward
to use and only exposes exactly what your users will need, let’s now turn to
Rust’s modules.

# Packages, Crates, and Modules

As you write large programs, organizing your code will become increasingly
important. By grouping related functionality and separating code with distinct
features, you’ll clarify where to find code that implements a particular
feature and where to go to change how a feature works.

The programs we’ve written so far have been in one module in one file. As a
project grows, you should organize code by splitting it into multiple modules
and then multiple files. A package can contain multiple binary crates and
optionally one library crate. As a package grows, you can extract parts into
separate crates that become external dependencies. This chapter covers all
these techniques. For very large projects comprising a set of interrelated
packages that evolve together, Cargo provides workspaces, which we’ll cover in
“Cargo Workspaces” in Chapter 14.

We’ll also discuss encapsulating implementation details, which lets you reuse
code at a higher level: Once you’ve implemented an operation, other code can
call your code via its public interface without having to know how the
implementation works. The way you write code defines which parts are public
for other code to use and which parts are private implementation details that
you reserve the right to change. This is another way to limit the amount of
detail you have to keep in your head.

A related concept is scope: The nested context in which code is written has a
set of names that are defined as “in scope.” When reading, writing, and
compiling code, programmers and compilers need to know whether a particular
name at a particular spot refers to a variable, function, struct, enum,
module, constant, or other item and what that item means. You can create
scopes and change which names are in or out of scope. You can’t have two items
with the same name in the same scope; tools are available to resolve name
conflicts.

Rust has a number of features that allow you to manage your code’s
organization, including which details are exposed, which details are private,
and what names are in each scope in your programs. These features, sometimes
collectively referred to as the _module system_ , include:

  * **Packages** : A Cargo feature that lets you build, test, and share crates
  * **Crates** : A tree of modules that produces a library or executable
  * **Modules and use** : Let you control the organization, scope, and privacy of paths
  * **Paths** : A way of naming an item, such as a struct, function, or module

In this chapter, we’ll cover all these features, discuss how they interact,
and explain how to use them to manage scope. By the end, you should have a
solid understanding of the module system and be able to work with scopes like
a pro!

# Packages and Crates

## Packages and Crates

The first parts of the module system we’ll cover are packages and crates.

A _crate_ is the smallest amount of code that the Rust compiler considers at a
time. Even if you run `rustc` rather than `cargo` and pass a single source
code file (as we did all the way back in “Rust Program Basics” in Chapter 1),
the compiler considers that file to be a crate. Crates can contain modules,
and the modules may be defined in other files that get compiled with the
crate, as we’ll see in the coming sections.

A crate can come in one of two forms: a binary crate or a library crate.
_Binary crates_ are programs you can compile to an executable that you can
run, such as a command line program or a server. Each must have a function
called `main` that defines what happens when the executable runs. All the
crates we’ve created so far have been binary crates.

_Library crates_ don’t have a `main` function, and they don’t compile to an
executable. Instead, they define functionality intended to be shared with
multiple projects. For example, the `rand` crate we used in Chapter 2 provides
functionality that generates random numbers. Most of the time when Rustaceans
say “crate,” they mean library crate, and they use “crate” interchangeably
with the general programming concept of a “library.”

The _crate root_ is a source file that the Rust compiler starts from and makes
up the root module of your crate (we’ll explain modules in depth in “Control
Scope and Privacy with Modules”).

A _package_ is a bundle of one or more crates that provides a set of
functionality. A package contains a _Cargo.toml_ file that describes how to
build those crates. Cargo is actually a package that contains the binary crate
for the command line tool you’ve been using to build your code. The Cargo
package also contains a library crate that the binary crate depends on. Other
projects can depend on the Cargo library crate to use the same logic the Cargo
command line tool uses.

A package can contain as many binary crates as you like, but at most only one
library crate. A package must contain at least one crate, whether that’s a
library or binary crate.

Let’s walk through what happens when we create a package. First, we enter the
command `cargo new my-project`:

    
    
    $ cargo new my-project
         Created binary (application) `my-project` package
    $ ls my-project
    Cargo.toml
    src
    $ ls my-project/src
    main.rs
    

After we run `cargo new my-project`, we use `ls` to see what Cargo creates. In
the _my-project_ directory, there’s a _Cargo.toml_ file, giving us a package.
There’s also a _src_ directory that contains _main.rs_. Open _Cargo.toml_ in
your text editor and note that there’s no mention of _src/main.rs_. Cargo
follows a convention that _src/main.rs_ is the crate root of a binary crate
with the same name as the package. Likewise, Cargo knows that if the package
directory contains _src/lib.rs_ , the package contains a library crate with
the same name as the package, and _src/lib.rs_ is its crate root. Cargo passes
the crate root files to `rustc` to build the library or binary.

Here, we have a package that only contains _src/main.rs_ , meaning it only
contains a binary crate named `my-project`. If a package contains
_src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_ , it has two crates: a binary and a library,
both with the same name as the package. A package can have multiple binary
crates by placing files in the _src/bin_ directory: Each file will be a
separate binary crate.

# Control Scope and Privacy with Modules

## Control Scope and Privacy with Modules

In this section, we’ll talk about modules and other parts of the module
system, namely _paths_ , which allow you to name items; the `use` keyword that
brings a path into scope; and the `pub` keyword to make items public. We’ll
also discuss the `as` keyword, external packages, and the glob operator.

### Modules Cheat Sheet

Before we get to the details of modules and paths, here we provide a quick
reference on how modules, paths, the `use` keyword, and the `pub` keyword work
in the compiler, and how most developers organize their code. We’ll be going
through examples of each of these rules throughout this chapter, but this is a
great place to refer to as a reminder of how modules work.

  * **Start from the crate root** : When compiling a crate, the compiler first looks in the crate root file (usually _src/lib.rs_ for a library crate and _src/main.rs_ for a binary crate) for code to compile.
  * **Declaring modules** : In the crate root file, you can declare new modules; say you declare a “garden” module with `mod garden;`. The compiler will look for the module’s code in these places: 
    * Inline, within curly brackets that replace the semicolon following `mod garden`
    * In the file _src/garden.rs_
    * In the file _src/garden/mod.rs_
  * **Declaring submodules** : In any file other than the crate root, you can declare submodules. For example, you might declare `mod vegetables;` in _src/garden.rs_. The compiler will look for the submodule’s code within the directory named for the parent module in these places: 
    * Inline, directly following `mod vegetables`, within curly brackets instead of the semicolon
    * In the file _src/garden/vegetables.rs_
    * In the file _src/garden/vegetables/mod.rs_
  * **Paths to code in modules** : Once a module is part of your crate, you can refer to code in that module from anywhere else in that same crate, as long as the privacy rules allow, using the path to the code. For example, an `Asparagus` type in the garden vegetables module would be found at `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`.
  * **Private vs. public** : Code within a module is private from its parent modules by default. To make a module public, declare it with `pub mod` instead of `mod`. To make items within a public module public as well, use `pub` before their declarations.
  * **The`use` keyword**: Within a scope, the `use` keyword creates shortcuts to items to reduce repetition of long paths. In any scope that can refer to `crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus`, you can create a shortcut with `use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;`, and from then on you only need to write `Asparagus` to make use of that type in the scope.

Here, we create a binary crate named `backyard` that illustrates these rules.
The crate’s directory, also named _backyard_ , contains these files and
directories:

    
    
    backyard
    ├── Cargo.lock
    ├── Cargo.toml
    └── src
        ├── garden
        │   └── vegetables.rs
        ├── garden.rs
        └── main.rs
    

The crate root file in this case is _src/main.rs_ , and it contains:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use crate::garden::vegetables::Asparagus;
    
    pub mod garden;
    
    fn main() {
        let plant = Asparagus {};
        println!("I'm growing {plant:?}!");
    }

The `pub mod garden;` line tells the compiler to include the code it finds in
_src/garden.rs_ , which is:

Filename: src/garden.rs

    
    
    pub mod vegetables;

Here, `pub mod vegetables;` means the code in _src/garden/vegetables.rs_ is
included too. That code is:

    
    
    #[derive(Debug)]
    pub struct Asparagus {}

Now let’s get into the details of these rules and demonstrate them in action!

### Grouping Related Code in Modules

_Modules_ let us organize code within a crate for readability and easy reuse.
Modules also allow us to control the _privacy_ of items because code within a
module is private by default. Private items are internal implementation
details not available for outside use. We can choose to make modules and the
items within them public, which exposes them to allow external code to use and
depend on them.

As an example, let’s write a library crate that provides the functionality of
a restaurant. We’ll define the signatures of functions but leave their bodies
empty to concentrate on the organization of the code rather than the
implementation of a restaurant.

In the restaurant industry, some parts of a restaurant are referred to as
front of house and others as back of house. _Front of house_ is where
customers are; this encompasses where the hosts seat customers, servers take
orders and payment, and bartenders make drinks. _Back of house_ is where the
chefs and cooks work in the kitchen, dishwashers clean up, and managers do
administrative work.

To structure our crate in this way, we can organize its functions into nested
modules. Create a new library named `restaurant` by running `cargo new
restaurant --lib`. Then, enter the code in Listing 7-1 into _src/lib.rs_ to
define some modules and function signatures; this code is the front of house
section.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        mod hosting {
            fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    
            fn seat_at_table() {}
        }
    
        mod serving {
            fn take_order() {}
    
            fn serve_order() {}
    
            fn take_payment() {}
        }
    }

Listing 7-1: A `front_of_house` module containing other modules that then
contain functions

We define a module with the `mod` keyword followed by the name of the module
(in this case, `front_of_house`). The body of the module then goes inside
curly brackets. Inside modules, we can place other modules, as in this case
with the modules `hosting` and `serving`. Modules can also hold definitions
for other items, such as structs, enums, constants, traits, and as in Listing
7-1, functions.

By using modules, we can group related definitions together and name why
they’re related. Programmers using this code can navigate the code based on
the groups rather than having to read through all the definitions, making it
easier to find the definitions relevant to them. Programmers adding new
functionality to this code would know where to place the code to keep the
program organized.

Earlier, we mentioned that _src/main.rs_ and _src/lib.rs_ are called _crate
roots_. The reason for their name is that the contents of either of these two
files form a module named `crate` at the root of the crate’s module structure,
known as the _module tree_.

Listing 7-2 shows the module tree for the structure in Listing 7-1.

    
    
    crate
     └── front_of_house
         ├── hosting
         │   ├── add_to_waitlist
         │   └── seat_at_table
         └── serving
             ├── take_order
             ├── serve_order
             └── take_payment
    

Listing 7-2: The module tree for the code in Listing 7-1

This tree shows how some of the modules nest inside other modules; for
example, `hosting` nests inside `front_of_house`. The tree also shows that
some modules are _siblings_ , meaning they’re defined in the same module;
`hosting` and `serving` are siblings defined within `front_of_house`. If
module A is contained inside module B, we say that module A is the _child_ of
module B and that module B is the _parent_ of module A. Notice that the entire
module tree is rooted under the implicit module named `crate`.

The module tree might remind you of the filesystem’s directory tree on your
computer; this is a very apt comparison! Just like directories in a
filesystem, you use modules to organize your code. And just like files in a
directory, we need a way to find our modules.

# Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

## Paths for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree

To show Rust where to find an item in a module tree, we use a path in the same
way we use a path when navigating a filesystem. To call a function, we need to
know its path.

A path can take two forms:

  * An _absolute path_ is the full path starting from a crate root; for code from an external crate, the absolute path begins with the crate name, and for code from the current crate, it starts with the literal `crate`.
  * A _relative path_ starts from the current module and uses `self`, `super`, or an identifier in the current module.

Both absolute and relative paths are followed by one or more identifiers
separated by double colons (`::`).

Returning to Listing 7-1, say we want to call the `add_to_waitlist` function.
This is the same as asking: What’s the path of the `add_to_waitlist` function?
Listing 7-3 contains Listing 7-1 with some of the modules and functions
removed.

We’ll show two ways to call the `add_to_waitlist` function from a new
function, `eat_at_restaurant`, defined in the crate root. These paths are
correct, but there’s another problem remaining that will prevent this example
from compiling as is. We’ll explain why in a bit.

The `eat_at_restaurant` function is part of our library crate’s public API, so
we mark it with the `pub` keyword. In the “Exposing Paths with the `pub`
Keyword” section, we’ll go into more detail about `pub`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        mod hosting {
            fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Absolute path
        crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    
        // Relative path
        front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-3: Calling the `add_to_waitlist` function using absolute and
relative paths

The first time we call the `add_to_waitlist` function in `eat_at_restaurant`,
we use an absolute path. The `add_to_waitlist` function is defined in the same
crate as `eat_at_restaurant`, which means we can use the `crate` keyword to
start an absolute path. We then include each of the successive modules until
we make our way to `add_to_waitlist`. You can imagine a filesystem with the
same structure: We’d specify the path
`/front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist` to run the `add_to_waitlist`
program; using the `crate` name to start from the crate root is like using `/`
to start from the filesystem root in your shell.

The second time we call `add_to_waitlist` in `eat_at_restaurant`, we use a
relative path. The path starts with `front_of_house`, the name of the module
defined at the same level of the module tree as `eat_at_restaurant`. Here the
filesystem equivalent would be using the path
`front_of_house/hosting/add_to_waitlist`. Starting with a module name means
that the path is relative.

Choosing whether to use a relative or absolute path is a decision you’ll make
based on your project, and it depends on whether you’re more likely to move
item definition code separately from or together with the code that uses the
item. For example, if we moved the `front_of_house` module and the
`eat_at_restaurant` function into a module named `customer_experience`, we’d
need to update the absolute path to `add_to_waitlist`, but the relative path
would still be valid. However, if we moved the `eat_at_restaurant` function
separately into a module named `dining`, the absolute path to the
`add_to_waitlist` call would stay the same, but the relative path would need
to be updated. Our preference in general is to specify absolute paths because
it’s more likely we’ll want to move code definitions and item calls
independently of each other.

Let’s try to compile Listing 7-3 and find out why it won’t compile yet! The
errors we get are shown in Listing 7-4.

    error: could not compile `restaurant` (lib) due to 2 previous errors
    

Listing 7-4: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-3

The error messages say that module `hosting` is private. In other words, we
have the correct paths for the `hosting` module and the `add_to_waitlist`
function, but Rust won’t let us use them because it doesn’t have access to the
private sections. In Rust, all items (functions, methods, structs, enums,
modules, and constants) are private to parent modules by default. If you want
to make an item like a function or struct private, you put it in a module.

Items in a parent module can’t use the private items inside child modules, but
items in child modules can use the items in their ancestor modules. This is
because child modules wrap and hide their implementation details, but the
child modules can see the context in which they’re defined. To continue with
our metaphor, think of the privacy rules as being like the back office of a
restaurant: What goes on in there is private to restaurant customers, but
office managers can see and do everything in the restaurant they operate.

Rust chose to have the module system function this way so that hiding inner
implementation details is the default. That way, you know which parts of the
inner code you can change without breaking the outer code. However, Rust does
give you the option to expose inner parts of child modules’ code to outer
ancestor modules by using the `pub` keyword to make an item public.

### Exposing Paths with the `pub` Keyword

Let’s return to the error in Listing 7-4 that told us the `hosting` module is
private. We want the `eat_at_restaurant` function in the parent module to have
access to the `add_to_waitlist` function in the child module, so we mark the
`hosting` module with the `pub` keyword, as shown in Listing 7-5.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    // -- snip --
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Absolute path
        crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    
        // Relative path
        front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-5: Declaring the `hosting` module as `pub` to use it from
`eat_at_restaurant`

Unfortunately, the code in Listing 7-5 still results in compiler errors, as
shown in Listing 7-6.

    error: could not compile `restaurant` (lib) due to 2 previous errors
    

Listing 7-6: Compiler errors from building the code in Listing 7-5

What happened? Adding the `pub` keyword in front of `mod hosting` makes the
module public. With this change, if we can access `front_of_house`, we can
access `hosting`. But the _contents_ of `hosting` are still private; making
the module public doesn’t make its contents public. The `pub` keyword on a
module only lets code in its ancestor modules refer to it, not access its
inner code. Because modules are containers, there’s not much we can do by only
making the module public; we need to go further and choose to make one or more
of the items within the module public as well.

The errors in Listing 7-6 say that the `add_to_waitlist` function is private.
The privacy rules apply to structs, enums, functions, and methods as well as
modules.

Let’s also make the `add_to_waitlist` function public by adding the `pub`
keyword before its definition, as in Listing 7-7.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    // -- snip --
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Absolute path
        crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    
        // Relative path
        front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-7: Adding the `pub` keyword to `mod hosting` and `fn
add_to_waitlist` lets us call the function from `eat_at_restaurant`.

Now the code will compile! To see why adding the `pub` keyword lets us use
these paths in `eat_at_restaurant` with respect to the privacy rules, let’s
look at the absolute and the relative paths.

In the absolute path, we start with `crate`, the root of our crate’s module
tree. The `front_of_house` module is defined in the crate root. While
`front_of_house` isn’t public, because the `eat_at_restaurant` function is
defined in the same module as `front_of_house` (that is, `eat_at_restaurant`
and `front_of_house` are siblings), we can refer to `front_of_house` from
`eat_at_restaurant`. Next is the `hosting` module marked with `pub`. We can
access the parent module of `hosting`, so we can access `hosting`. Finally,
the `add_to_waitlist` function is marked with `pub`, and we can access its
parent module, so this function call works!

In the relative path, the logic is the same as the absolute path except for
the first step: Rather than starting from the crate root, the path starts from
`front_of_house`. The `front_of_house` module is defined within the same
module as `eat_at_restaurant`, so the relative path starting from the module
in which `eat_at_restaurant` is defined works. Then, because `hosting` and
`add_to_waitlist` are marked with `pub`, the rest of the path works, and this
function call is valid!

If you plan to share your library crate so that other projects can use your
code, your public API is your contract with users of your crate that
determines how they can interact with your code. There are many considerations
around managing changes to your public API to make it easier for people to
depend on your crate. These considerations are beyond the scope of this book;
if you’re interested in this topic, see [the Rust API
Guidelines](https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/).

#### Best Practices for Packages with a Binary and a Library

We mentioned that a package can contain both a _src/main.rs_ binary crate root
as well as a _src/lib.rs_ library crate root, and both crates will have the
package name by default. Typically, packages with this pattern of containing
both a library and a binary crate will have just enough code in the binary
crate to start an executable that calls code defined in the library crate.
This lets other projects benefit from the most functionality that the package
provides because the library crate’s code can be shared.

The module tree should be defined in _src/lib.rs_. Then, any public items can
be used in the binary crate by starting paths with the name of the package.
The binary crate becomes a user of the library crate just like a completely
external crate would use the library crate: It can only use the public API.
This helps you design a good API; not only are you the author, but you’re also
a client!

In Chapter 12, we’ll demonstrate this organizational practice with a command
line program that will contain both a binary crate and a library crate.

### Starting Relative Paths with `super`

We can construct relative paths that begin in the parent module, rather than
the current module or the crate root, by using `super` at the start of the
path. This is like starting a filesystem path with the `..` syntax that means
to go to the parent directory. Using `super` allows us to reference an item
that we know is in the parent module, which can make rearranging the module
tree easier when the module is closely related to the parent but the parent
might be moved elsewhere in the module tree someday.

Consider the code in Listing 7-8 that models the situation in which a chef
fixes an incorrect order and personally brings it out to the customer. The
function `fix_incorrect_order` defined in the `back_of_house` module calls the
function `deliver_order` defined in the parent module by specifying the path
to `deliver_order`, starting with `super`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    fn deliver_order() {}
    
    mod back_of_house {
        fn fix_incorrect_order() {
            cook_order();
            super::deliver_order();
        }
    
        fn cook_order() {}
    }

Listing 7-8: Calling a function using a relative path starting with `super`

The `fix_incorrect_order` function is in the `back_of_house` module, so we can
use `super` to go to the parent module of `back_of_house`, which in this case
is `crate`, the root. From there, we look for `deliver_order` and find it.
Success! We think the `back_of_house` module and the `deliver_order` function
are likely to stay in the same relationship to each other and get moved
together should we decide to reorganize the crate’s module tree. Therefore, we
used `super` so that we’ll have fewer places to update code in the future if
this code gets moved to a different module.

### Making Structs and Enums Public

We can also use `pub` to designate structs and enums as public, but there are
a few extra details to the usage of `pub` with structs and enums. If we use
`pub` before a struct definition, we make the struct public, but the struct’s
fields will still be private. We can make each field public or not on a case-
by-case basis. In Listing 7-9, we’ve defined a public
`back_of_house::Breakfast` struct with a public `toast` field but a private
`seasonal_fruit` field. This models the case in a restaurant where the
customer can pick the type of bread that comes with a meal, but the chef
decides which fruit accompanies the meal based on what’s in season and in
stock. The available fruit changes quickly, so customers can’t choose the
fruit or even see which fruit they’ll get.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod back_of_house {
        pub struct Breakfast {
            pub toast: String,
            seasonal_fruit: String,
        }
    
        impl Breakfast {
            pub fn summer(toast: &str) -> Breakfast {
                Breakfast {
                    toast: String::from(toast),
                    seasonal_fruit: String::from("peaches"),
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        // Order a breakfast in the summer with Rye toast.
        let mut meal = back_of_house::Breakfast::summer("Rye");
        // Change our mind about what bread we'd like.
        meal.toast = String::from("Wheat");
        println!("I'd like {} toast please", meal.toast);
    
        // The next line won't compile if we uncomment it; we're not allowed
        // to see or modify the seasonal fruit that comes with the meal.
        // meal.seasonal_fruit = String::from("blueberries");
    }

Listing 7-9: A struct with some public fields and some private fields

Because the `toast` field in the `back_of_house::Breakfast` struct is public,
in `eat_at_restaurant` we can write and read to the `toast` field using dot
notation. Notice that we can’t use the `seasonal_fruit` field in
`eat_at_restaurant`, because `seasonal_fruit` is private. Try uncommenting the
line modifying the `seasonal_fruit` field value to see what error you get!

Also, note that because `back_of_house::Breakfast` has a private field, the
struct needs to provide a public associated function that constructs an
instance of `Breakfast` (we’ve named it `summer` here). If `Breakfast` didn’t
have such a function, we couldn’t create an instance of `Breakfast` in
`eat_at_restaurant`, because we couldn’t set the value of the private
`seasonal_fruit` field in `eat_at_restaurant`.

In contrast, if we make an enum public, all of its variants are then public.
We only need the `pub` before the `enum` keyword, as shown in Listing 7-10.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod back_of_house {
        pub enum Appetizer {
            Soup,
            Salad,
        }
    }
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        let order1 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Soup;
        let order2 = back_of_house::Appetizer::Salad;
    }

Listing 7-10: Designating an enum as public makes all its variants public.

Because we made the `Appetizer` enum public, we can use the `Soup` and `Salad`
variants in `eat_at_restaurant`.

Enums aren’t very useful unless their variants are public; it would be
annoying to have to annotate all enum variants with `pub` in every case, so
the default for enum variants is to be public. Structs are often useful
without their fields being public, so struct fields follow the general rule of
everything being private by default unless annotated with `pub`.

There’s one more situation involving `pub` that we haven’t covered, and that
is our last module system feature: the `use` keyword. We’ll cover `use` by
itself first, and then we’ll show how to combine `pub` and `use`.

# Bringing Paths Into Scope with the use Keyword

## Bringing Paths into Scope with the `use` Keyword

Having to write out the paths to call functions can feel inconvenient and
repetitive. In Listing 7-7, whether we chose the absolute or relative path to
the `add_to_waitlist` function, every time we wanted to call `add_to_waitlist`
we had to specify `front_of_house` and `hosting` too. Fortunately, there’s a
way to simplify this process: We can create a shortcut to a path with the
`use` keyword once and then use the shorter name everywhere else in the scope.

In Listing 7-11, we bring the `crate::front_of_house::hosting` module into the
scope of the `eat_at_restaurant` function so that we only have to specify
`hosting::add_to_waitlist` to call the `add_to_waitlist` function in
`eat_at_restaurant`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-11: Bringing a module into scope with `use`

Adding `use` and a path in a scope is similar to creating a symbolic link in
the filesystem. By adding `use crate::front_of_house::hosting` in the crate
root, `hosting` is now a valid name in that scope, just as though the
`hosting` module had been defined in the crate root. Paths brought into scope
with `use` also check privacy, like any other paths.

Note that `use` only creates the shortcut for the particular scope in which
the `use` occurs. Listing 7-12 moves the `eat_at_restaurant` function into a
new child module named `customer`, which is then a different scope than the
`use` statement, so the function body won’t compile.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
    
    mod customer {
        pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
            hosting::add_to_waitlist();
        }
    }

Listing 7-12: A `use` statement only applies in the scope it’s in.

The compiler error shows that the shortcut no longer applies within the
`customer` module:

Notice there’s also a warning that the `use` is no longer used in its scope!
To fix this problem, move the `use` within the `customer` module too, or
reference the shortcut in the parent module with `super::hosting` within the
child `customer` module.

### Creating Idiomatic `use` Paths

In Listing 7-11, you might have wondered why we specified `use
crate::front_of_house::hosting` and then called `hosting::add_to_waitlist` in
`eat_at_restaurant`, rather than specifying the `use` path all the way out to
the `add_to_waitlist` function to achieve the same result, as in Listing 7-13.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    use crate::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist;
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-13: Bringing the `add_to_waitlist` function into scope with `use`,
which is unidiomatic

Although both Listing 7-11 and Listing 7-13 accomplish the same task, Listing
7-11 is the idiomatic way to bring a function into scope with `use`. Bringing
the function’s parent module into scope with `use` means we have to specify
the parent module when calling the function. Specifying the parent module when
calling the function makes it clear that the function isn’t locally defined
while still minimizing repetition of the full path. The code in Listing 7-13
is unclear as to where `add_to_waitlist` is defined.

On the other hand, when bringing in structs, enums, and other items with
`use`, it’s idiomatic to specify the full path. Listing 7-14 shows the
idiomatic way to bring the standard library’s `HashMap` struct into the scope
of a binary crate.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    
    fn main() {
        let mut map = HashMap::new();
        map.insert(1, 2);
    }

Listing 7-14: Bringing `HashMap` into scope in an idiomatic way

There’s no strong reason behind this idiom: It’s just the convention that has
emerged, and folks have gotten used to reading and writing Rust code this way.

The exception to this idiom is if we’re bringing two items with the same name
into scope with `use` statements, because Rust doesn’t allow that. Listing
7-15 shows how to bring two `Result` types into scope that have the same name
but different parent modules, and how to refer to them.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    use std::fmt;
    use std::io;
    
    fn function1() -> fmt::Result {
        // --snip--
        Ok(())
    }
    
    fn function2() -> io::Result<()> {
        // --snip--
        Ok(())
    }

Listing 7-15: Bringing two types with the same name into the same scope
requires using their parent modules.

As you can see, using the parent modules distinguishes the two `Result` types.
If instead we specified `use std::fmt::Result` and `use std::io::Result`, we’d
have two `Result` types in the same scope, and Rust wouldn’t know which one we
meant when we used `Result`.

### Providing New Names with the `as` Keyword

There’s another solution to the problem of bringing two types of the same name
into the same scope with `use`: After the path, we can specify `as` and a new
local name, or _alias_ , for the type. Listing 7-16 shows another way to write
the code in Listing 7-15 by renaming one of the two `Result` types using `as`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    use std::fmt::Result;
    use std::io::Result as IoResult;
    
    fn function1() -> Result {
        // --snip--
        Ok(())
    }
    
    fn function2() -> IoResult<()> {
        // --snip--
        Ok(())
    }

Listing 7-16: Renaming a type when it’s brought into scope with the `as`
keyword

In the second `use` statement, we chose the new name `IoResult` for the
`std::io::Result` type, which won’t conflict with the `Result` from `std::fmt`
that we’ve also brought into scope. Listing 7-15 and Listing 7-16 are
considered idiomatic, so the choice is up to you!

### Re-exporting Names with `pub use`

When we bring a name into scope with the `use` keyword, the name is private to
the scope into which we imported it. To enable code outside that scope to
refer to that name as if it had been defined in that scope, we can combine
`pub` and `use`. This technique is called _re-exporting_ because we’re
bringing an item into scope but also making that item available for others to
bring into their scope.

Listing 7-17 shows the code in Listing 7-11 with `use` in the root module
changed to `pub use`.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house {
        pub mod hosting {
            pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
        }
    }
    
    pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-17: Making a name available for any code to use from a new scope
with `pub use`

Before this change, external code would have to call the `add_to_waitlist`
function by using the path
`restaurant::front_of_house::hosting::add_to_waitlist()`, which also would
have required the `front_of_house` module to be marked as `pub`. Now that this
`pub use` has re-exported the `hosting` module from the root module, external
code can use the path `restaurant::hosting::add_to_waitlist()` instead.

Re-exporting is useful when the internal structure of your code is different
from how programmers calling your code would think about the domain. For
example, in this restaurant metaphor, the people running the restaurant think
about “front of house” and “back of house.” But customers visiting a
restaurant probably won’t think about the parts of the restaurant in those
terms. With `pub use`, we can write our code with one structure but expose a
different structure. Doing so makes our library well organized for programmers
working on the library and programmers calling the library. We’ll look at
another example of `pub use` and how it affects your crate’s documentation in
“Exporting a Convenient Public API” in Chapter 14.

### Using External Packages

In Chapter 2, we programmed a guessing game project that used an external
package called `rand` to get random numbers. To use `rand` in our project, we
added this line to _Cargo.toml_ :

Filename: Cargo.toml

    
    
    rand = "0.8.5"
    

Adding `rand` as a dependency in _Cargo.toml_ tells Cargo to download the
`rand` package and any dependencies from [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and
make `rand` available to our project.

Then, to bring `rand` definitions into the scope of our package, we added a
`use` line starting with the name of the crate, `rand`, and listed the items
we wanted to bring into scope. Recall that in “Generating a Random Number” in
Chapter 2, we brought the `Rng` trait into scope and called the
`rand::thread_rng` function:

    
    
    use std::io;
    
    use rand::Rng;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    }

Members of the Rust community have made many packages available at
[crates.io](https://crates.io/), and pulling any of them into your package
involves these same steps: listing them in your package’s _Cargo.toml_ file
and using `use` to bring items from their crates into scope.

Note that the standard `std` library is also a crate that’s external to our
package. Because the standard library is shipped with the Rust language, we
don’t need to change _Cargo.toml_ to include `std`. But we do need to refer to
it with `use` to bring items from there into our package’s scope. For example,
with `HashMap` we would use this line:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use std::collections::HashMap;
    }

This is an absolute path starting with `std`, the name of the standard library
crate.

### Using Nested Paths to Clean Up `use` Lists

If we’re using multiple items defined in the same crate or same module,
listing each item on its own line can take up a lot of vertical space in our
files. For example, these two `use` statements we had in the guessing game in
Listing 2-4 bring items from `std` into scope:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use rand::Rng;
    // --snip--
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    // --snip--
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }

Instead, we can use nested paths to bring the same items into scope in one
line. We do this by specifying the common part of the path, followed by two
colons, and then curly brackets around a list of the parts of the paths that
differ, as shown in Listing 7-18.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use rand::Rng;
    // --snip--
    use std::{cmp::Ordering, io};
    // --snip--
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        println!("The secret number is: {secret_number}");
    
        println!("Please input your guess.");
    
        let mut guess = String::new();
    
        io::stdin()
            .read_line(&mut guess)
            .expect("Failed to read line");
    
        let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");
    
        println!("You guessed: {guess}");
    
        match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
            Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
            Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
            Ordering::Equal => println!("You win!"),
        }
    }

Listing 7-18: Specifying a nested path to bring multiple items with the same
prefix into scope

In bigger programs, bringing many items into scope from the same crate or
module using nested paths can reduce the number of separate `use` statements
needed by a lot!

We can use a nested path at any level in a path, which is useful when
combining two `use` statements that share a subpath. For example, Listing 7-19
shows two `use` statements: one that brings `std::io` into scope and one that
brings `std::io::Write` into scope.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    use std::io;
    use std::io::Write;

Listing 7-19: Two `use` statements where one is a subpath of the other

The common part of these two paths is `std::io`, and that’s the complete first
path. To merge these two paths into one `use` statement, we can use `self` in
the nested path, as shown in Listing 7-20.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    use std::io::{self, Write};

Listing 7-20: Combining the paths in Listing 7-19 into one `use` statement

This line brings `std::io` and `std::io::Write` into scope.

### Importing Items with the Glob Operator

If we want to bring _all_ public items defined in a path into scope, we can
specify that path followed by the `*` glob operator:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use std::collections::*;
    }

This `use` statement brings all public items defined in `std::collections`
into the current scope. Be careful when using the glob operator! Glob can make
it harder to tell what names are in scope and where a name used in your
program was defined. Additionally, if the dependency changes its definitions,
what you’ve imported changes as well, which may lead to compiler errors when
you upgrade the dependency if the dependency adds a definition with the same
name as a definition of yours in the same scope, for example.

The glob operator is often used when testing to bring everything under test
into the `tests` module; we’ll talk about that in “How to Write Tests” in
Chapter 11. The glob operator is also sometimes used as part of the prelude
pattern: See [the standard library
documentation](../std/prelude/index.html#other-preludes) for more information
on that pattern.

# Separating Modules into Different Files

## Separating Modules into Different Files

So far, all the examples in this chapter defined multiple modules in one file.
When modules get large, you might want to move their definitions to a separate
file to make the code easier to navigate.

For example, let’s start from the code in Listing 7-17 that had multiple
restaurant modules. We’ll extract modules into files instead of having all the
modules defined in the crate root file. In this case, the crate root file is
_src/lib.rs_ , but this procedure also works with binary crates whose crate
root file is _src/main.rs_.

First, we’ll extract the `front_of_house` module to its own file. Remove the
code inside the curly brackets for the `front_of_house` module, leaving only
the `mod front_of_house;` declaration, so that _src/lib.rs_ contains the code
shown in Listing 7-21. Note that this won’t compile until we create the
_src/front_of_house.rs_ file in Listing 7-22.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    mod front_of_house;
    
    pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting;
    
    pub fn eat_at_restaurant() {
        hosting::add_to_waitlist();
    }

Listing 7-21: Declaring the `front_of_house` module whose body will be in
_src/front_of_house.rs_

Next, place the code that was in the curly brackets into a new file named
_src/front_of_house.rs_ , as shown in Listing 7-22. The compiler knows to look
in this file because it came across the module declaration in the crate root
with the name `front_of_house`.

Filename: src/front_of_house.rs

    
    
    pub mod hosting {
        pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}
    }

Listing 7-22: Definitions inside the `front_of_house` module in
_src/front_of_house.rs_

Note that you only need to load a file using a `mod` declaration _once_ in
your module tree. Once the compiler knows the file is part of the project (and
knows where in the module tree the code resides because of where you’ve put
the `mod` statement), other files in your project should refer to the loaded
file’s code using a path to where it was declared, as covered in the “Paths
for Referring to an Item in the Module Tree” section. In other words, `mod` is
_not_ an “include” operation that you may have seen in other programming
languages.

Next, we’ll extract the `hosting` module to its own file. The process is a bit
different because `hosting` is a child module of `front_of_house`, not of the
root module. We’ll place the file for `hosting` in a new directory that will
be named for its ancestors in the module tree, in this case
_src/front_of_house_.

To start moving `hosting`, we change _src/front_of_house.rs_ to contain only
the declaration of the `hosting` module:

Filename: src/front_of_house.rs

    
    
    pub mod hosting;

Then, we create a _src/front_of_house_ directory and a _hosting.rs_ file to
contain the definitions made in the `hosting` module:

Filename: src/front_of_house/hosting.rs

    
    
    pub fn add_to_waitlist() {}

If we instead put _hosting.rs_ in the _src_ directory, the compiler would
expect the _hosting.rs_ code to be in a `hosting` module declared in the crate
root and not declared as a child of the `front_of_house` module. The
compiler’s rules for which files to check for which modules’ code mean the
directories and files more closely match the module tree.

### Alternate File Paths

So far we’ve covered the most idiomatic file paths the Rust compiler uses, but
Rust also supports an older style of file path. For a module named
`front_of_house` declared in the crate root, the compiler will look for the
module’s code in:

  * _src/front_of_house.rs_ (what we covered)
  * _src/front_of_house/mod.rs_ (older style, still supported path)

For a module named `hosting` that is a submodule of `front_of_house`, the
compiler will look for the module’s code in:

  * _src/front_of_house/hosting.rs_ (what we covered)
  * _src/front_of_house/hosting/mod.rs_ (older style, still supported path)

If you use both styles for the same module, you’ll get a compiler error. Using
a mix of both styles for different modules in the same project is allowed but
might be confusing for people navigating your project.

The main downside to the style that uses files named _mod.rs_ is that your
project can end up with many files named _mod.rs_ , which can get confusing
when you have them open in your editor at the same time.

We’ve moved each module’s code to a separate file, and the module tree remains
the same. The function calls in `eat_at_restaurant` will work without any
modification, even though the definitions live in different files. This
technique lets you move modules to new files as they grow in size.

Note that the `pub use crate::front_of_house::hosting` statement in
_src/lib.rs_ also hasn’t changed, nor does `use` have any impact on what files
are compiled as part of the crate. The `mod` keyword declares modules, and
Rust looks in a file with the same name as the module for the code that goes
into that module.

## Summary

Rust lets you split a package into multiple crates and a crate into modules so
that you can refer to items defined in one module from another module. You can
do this by specifying absolute or relative paths. These paths can be brought
into scope with a `use` statement so that you can use a shorter path for
multiple uses of the item in that scope. Module code is private by default,
but you can make definitions public by adding the `pub` keyword.

In the next chapter, we’ll look at some collection data structures in the
standard library that you can use in your neatly organized code.

# Common Collections

Rust’s standard library includes a number of very useful data structures
called _collections_. Most other data types represent one specific value, but
collections can contain multiple values. Unlike the built-in array and tuple
types, the data that these collections point to is stored on the heap, which
means the amount of data does not need to be known at compile time and can
grow or shrink as the program runs. Each kind of collection has different
capabilities and costs, and choosing an appropriate one for your current
situation is a skill you’ll develop over time. In this chapter, we’ll discuss
three collections that are used very often in Rust programs:

  * A _vector_ allows you to store a variable number of values next to each other.
  * A _string_ is a collection of characters. We’ve mentioned the `String` type previously, but in this chapter, we’ll talk about it in depth.
  * A _hash map_ allows you to associate a value with a specific key. It’s a particular implementation of the more general data structure called a _map_.

To learn about the other kinds of collections provided by the standard
library, see [the documentation](../std/collections/index.html).

We’ll discuss how to create and update vectors, strings, and hash maps, as
well as what makes each special.

# Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

## Storing Lists of Values with Vectors

The first collection type we’ll look at is `Vec<T>`, also known as a vector.
Vectors allow you to store more than one value in a single data structure that
puts all the values next to each other in memory. Vectors can only store
values of the same type. They are useful when you have a list of items, such
as the lines of text in a file or the prices of items in a shopping cart.

### Creating a New Vector

To create a new, empty vector, we call the `Vec::new` function, as shown in
Listing 8-1.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let v: Vec<i32> = Vec::new();
    }

Listing 8-1: Creating a new, empty vector to hold values of type `i32`

Note that we added a type annotation here. Because we aren’t inserting any
values into this vector, Rust doesn’t know what kind of elements we intend to
store. This is an important point. Vectors are implemented using generics;
we’ll cover how to use generics with your own types in Chapter 10. For now,
know that the `Vec<T>` type provided by the standard library can hold any
type. When we create a vector to hold a specific type, we can specify the type
within angle brackets. In Listing 8-1, we’ve told Rust that the `Vec<T>` in
`v` will hold elements of the `i32` type.

More often, you’ll create a `Vec<T>` with initial values, and Rust will infer
the type of value you want to store, so you rarely need to do this type
annotation. Rust conveniently provides the `vec!` macro, which will create a
new vector that holds the values you give it. Listing 8-2 creates a new
`Vec<i32>` that holds the values `1`, `2`, and `3`. The integer type is `i32`
because that’s the default integer type, as we discussed in the “Data Types”
section of Chapter 3.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    }

Listing 8-2: Creating a new vector containing values

Because we’ve given initial `i32` values, Rust can infer that the type of `v`
is `Vec<i32>`, and the type annotation isn’t necessary. Next, we’ll look at
how to modify a vector.

### Updating a Vector

To create a vector and then add elements to it, we can use the `push` method,
as shown in Listing 8-3.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut v = Vec::new();
    
        v.push(5);
        v.push(6);
        v.push(7);
        v.push(8);
    }

Listing 8-3: Using the `push` method to add values to a vector

As with any variable, if we want to be able to change its value, we need to
make it mutable using the `mut` keyword, as discussed in Chapter 3. The
numbers we place inside are all of type `i32`, and Rust infers this from the
data, so we don’t need the `Vec<i32>` annotation.

### Reading Elements of Vectors

There are two ways to reference a value stored in a vector: via indexing or by
using the `get` method. In the following examples, we’ve annotated the types
of the values that are returned from these functions for extra clarity.

Listing 8-4 shows both methods of accessing a value in a vector, with indexing
syntax and the `get` method.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
        let third: &i32 = &v[2];
        println!("The third element is {third}");
    
        let third: Option<&i32> = v.get(2);
        match third {
            Some(third) => println!("The third element is {third}"),
            None => println!("There is no third element."),
        }
    }

Listing 8-4: Using indexing syntax and using the `get` method to access an
item in a vector

Note a few details here. We use the index value of `2` to get the third
element because vectors are indexed by number, starting at zero. Using `&` and
`[]` gives us a reference to the element at the index value. When we use the
`get` method with the index passed as an argument, we get an `Option<&T>` that
we can use with `match`.

Rust provides these two ways to reference an element so that you can choose
how the program behaves when you try to use an index value outside the range
of existing elements. As an example, let’s see what happens when we have a
vector of five elements and then we try to access an element at index 100 with
each technique, as shown in Listing 8-5.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
        let does_not_exist = &v[100];
        let does_not_exist = v.get(100);
    }

Listing 8-5: Attempting to access the element at index 100 in a vector
containing five elements

When we run this code, the first `[]` method will cause the program to panic
because it references a nonexistent element. This method is best used when you
want your program to crash if there’s an attempt to access an element past the
end of the vector.

When the `get` method is passed an index that is outside the vector, it
returns `None` without panicking. You would use this method if accessing an
element beyond the range of the vector may happen occasionally under normal
circumstances. Your code will then have logic to handle having either
`Some(&element)` or `None`, as discussed in Chapter 6. For example, the index
could be coming from a person entering a number. If they accidentally enter a
number that’s too large and the program gets a `None` value, you could tell
the user how many items are in the current vector and give them another chance
to enter a valid value. That would be more user-friendly than crashing the
program due to a typo!

When the program has a valid reference, the borrow checker enforces the
ownership and borrowing rules (covered in Chapter 4) to ensure that this
reference and any other references to the contents of the vector remain valid.
Recall the rule that states you can’t have mutable and immutable references in
the same scope. That rule applies in Listing 8-6, where we hold an immutable
reference to the first element in a vector and try to add an element to the
end. This program won’t work if we also try to refer to that element later in
the function.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    
        let first = &v[0];
    
        v.push(6);
    
        println!("The first element is: {first}");
    }

Listing 8-6: Attempting to add an element to a vector while holding a
reference to an item

Compiling this code will result in this error:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
    error[E0502]: cannot borrow `v` as mutable because it is also borrowed as immutable
     --> src/main.rs:6:5
      |
    4 |     let first = &v[0];
      |                  - immutable borrow occurs here
    5 |
    6 |     v.push(6);
      |     ^^^^^^^^^ mutable borrow occurs here
    7 |
    8 |     println!("The first element is: {first}");
      |                                      ----- immutable borrow later used here
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0502`.
    error: could not compile `collections` (bin "collections") due to 1 previous error
    

The code in Listing 8-6 might look like it should work: Why should a reference
to the first element care about changes at the end of the vector? This error
is due to the way vectors work: Because vectors put the values next to each
other in memory, adding a new element onto the end of the vector might require
allocating new memory and copying the old elements to the new space, if there
isn’t enough room to put all the elements next to each other where the vector
is currently stored. In that case, the reference to the first element would be
pointing to deallocated memory. The borrowing rules prevent programs from
ending up in that situation.

Note: For more on the implementation details of the `Vec<T>` type, see [“The
Rustonomicon”](../nomicon/vec/vec.html).

### Iterating Over the Values in a Vector

To access each element in a vector in turn, we would iterate through all of
the elements rather than use indices to access one at a time. Listing 8-7
shows how to use a `for` loop to get immutable references to each element in a
vector of `i32` values and print them.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let v = vec![100, 32, 57];
        for i in &v {
            println!("{i}");
        }
    }

Listing 8-7: Printing each element in a vector by iterating over the elements
using a `for` loop

We can also iterate over mutable references to each element in a mutable
vector in order to make changes to all the elements. The `for` loop in Listing
8-8 will add `50` to each element.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut v = vec![100, 32, 57];
        for i in &mut v {
            *i += 50;
        }
    }

Listing 8-8: Iterating over mutable references to elements in a vector

To change the value that the mutable reference refers to, we have to use the
`*` dereference operator to get to the value in `i` before we can use the `+=`
operator. We’ll talk more about the dereference operator in the “Following the
Reference to the Value” section of Chapter 15.

Iterating over a vector, whether immutably or mutably, is safe because of the
borrow checker’s rules. If we attempted to insert or remove items in the `for`
loop bodies in Listing 8-7 and Listing 8-8, we would get a compiler error
similar to the one we got with the code in Listing 8-6. The reference to the
vector that the `for` loop holds prevents simultaneous modification of the
whole vector.

### Using an Enum to Store Multiple Types

Vectors can only store values that are of the same type. This can be
inconvenient; there are definitely use cases for needing to store a list of
items of different types. Fortunately, the variants of an enum are defined
under the same enum type, so when we need one type to represent elements of
different types, we can define and use an enum!

For example, say we want to get values from a row in a spreadsheet in which
some of the columns in the row contain integers, some floating-point numbers,
and some strings. We can define an enum whose variants will hold the different
value types, and all the enum variants will be considered the same type: that
of the enum. Then, we can create a vector to hold that enum and so,
ultimately, hold different types. We’ve demonstrated this in Listing 8-9.

    
    
    fn main() {
        enum SpreadsheetCell {
            Int(i32),
            Float(f64),
            Text(String),
        }
    
        let row = vec![
            SpreadsheetCell::Int(3),
            SpreadsheetCell::Text(String::from("blue")),
            SpreadsheetCell::Float(10.12),
        ];
    }

Listing 8-9: Defining an enum to store values of different types in one vector

Rust needs to know what types will be in the vector at compile time so that it
knows exactly how much memory on the heap will be needed to store each
element. We must also be explicit about what types are allowed in this vector.
If Rust allowed a vector to hold any type, there would be a chance that one or
more of the types would cause errors with the operations performed on the
elements of the vector. Using an enum plus a `match` expression means that
Rust will ensure at compile time that every possible case is handled, as
discussed in Chapter 6.

If you don’t know the exhaustive set of types a program will get at runtime to
store in a vector, the enum technique won’t work. Instead, you can use a trait
object, which we’ll cover in Chapter 18.

Now that we’ve discussed some of the most common ways to use vectors, be sure
to review [the API documentation](../std/vec/struct.Vec.html) for all of the
many useful methods defined on `Vec<T>` by the standard library. For example,
in addition to `push`, a `pop` method removes and returns the last element.

### Dropping a Vector Drops Its Elements

Like any other `struct`, a vector is freed when it goes out of scope, as
annotated in Listing 8-10.

    
    
    fn main() {
        {
            let v = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
    
            // do stuff with v
        } // <- v goes out of scope and is freed here
    }

Listing 8-10: Showing where the vector and its elements are dropped

When the vector gets dropped, all of its contents are also dropped, meaning
the integers it holds will be cleaned up. The borrow checker ensures that any
references to contents of a vector are only used while the vector itself is
valid.

Let’s move on to the next collection type: `String`!

# Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

## Storing UTF-8 Encoded Text with Strings

We talked about strings in Chapter 4, but we’ll look at them in more depth
now. New Rustaceans commonly get stuck on strings for a combination of three
reasons: Rust’s propensity for exposing possible errors, strings being a more
complicated data structure than many programmers give them credit for, and
UTF-8. These factors combine in a way that can seem difficult when you’re
coming from other programming languages.

We discuss strings in the context of collections because strings are
implemented as a collection of bytes, plus some methods to provide useful
functionality when those bytes are interpreted as text. In this section, we’ll
talk about the operations on `String` that every collection type has, such as
creating, updating, and reading. We’ll also discuss the ways in which `String`
is different from the other collections, namely, how indexing into a `String`
is complicated by the differences between how people and computers interpret
`String` data.

### Defining Strings

We’ll first define what we mean by the term _string_. Rust has only one string
type in the core language, which is the string slice `str` that is usually
seen in its borrowed form, `&str`. In Chapter 4, we talked about string
slices, which are references to some UTF-8 encoded string data stored
elsewhere. String literals, for example, are stored in the program’s binary
and are therefore string slices.

The `String` type, which is provided by Rust’s standard library rather than
coded into the core language, is a growable, mutable, owned, UTF-8 encoded
string type. When Rustaceans refer to “strings” in Rust, they might be
referring to either the `String` or the string slice `&str` types, not just
one of those types. Although this section is largely about `String`, both
types are used heavily in Rust’s standard library, and both `String` and
string slices are UTF-8 encoded.

### Creating a New String

Many of the same operations available with `Vec<T>` are available with
`String` as well because `String` is actually implemented as a wrapper around
a vector of bytes with some extra guarantees, restrictions, and capabilities.
An example of a function that works the same way with `Vec<T>` and `String` is
the `new` function to create an instance, shown in Listing 8-11.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::new();
    }

Listing 8-11: Creating a new, empty `String`

This line creates a new, empty string called `s`, into which we can then load
data. Often, we’ll have some initial data with which we want to start the
string. For that, we use the `to_string` method, which is available on any
type that implements the `Display` trait, as string literals do. Listing 8-12
shows two examples.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let data = "initial contents";
    
        let s = data.to_string();
    
        // The method also works on a literal directly:
        let s = "initial contents".to_string();
    }

Listing 8-12: Using the `to_string` method to create a `String` from a string
literal

This code creates a string containing `initial contents`.

We can also use the function `String::from` to create a `String` from a string
literal. The code in Listing 8-13 is equivalent to the code in Listing 8-12
that uses `to_string`.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s = String::from("initial contents");
    }

Listing 8-13: Using the `String::from` function to create a `String` from a
string literal

Because strings are used for so many things, we can use many different generic
APIs for strings, providing us with a lot of options. Some of them can seem
redundant, but they all have their place! In this case, `String::from` and
`to_string` do the same thing, so which one you choose is a matter of style
and readability.

Remember that strings are UTF-8 encoded, so we can include any properly
encoded data in them, as shown in Listing 8-14.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
        let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
        let hello = String::from("Hello");
        let hello = String::from("שלום");
        let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
        let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
        let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
        let hello = String::from("你好");
        let hello = String::from("Olá");
        let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
        let hello = String::from("Hola");
    }

Listing 8-14: Storing greetings in different languages in strings

All of these are valid `String` values.

### Updating a String

A `String` can grow in size and its contents can change, just like the
contents of a `Vec<T>`, if you push more data into it. In addition, you can
conveniently use the `+` operator or the `format!` macro to concatenate
`String` values.

#### Appending with `push_str` or `push`

We can grow a `String` by using the `push_str` method to append a string
slice, as shown in Listing 8-15.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("foo");
        s.push_str("bar");
    }

Listing 8-15: Appending a string slice to a `String` using the `push_str`
method

After these two lines, `s` will contain `foobar`. The `push_str` method takes
a string slice because we don’t necessarily want to take ownership of the
parameter. For example, in the code in Listing 8-16, we want to be able to use
`s2` after appending its contents to `s1`.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s1 = String::from("foo");
        let s2 = "bar";
        s1.push_str(s2);
        println!("s2 is {s2}");
    }

Listing 8-16: Using a string slice after appending its contents to a `String`

If the `push_str` method took ownership of `s2`, we wouldn’t be able to print
its value on the last line. However, this code works as we’d expect!

The `push` method takes a single character as a parameter and adds it to the
`String`. Listing 8-17 adds the letter _l_ to a `String` using the `push`
method.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let mut s = String::from("lo");
        s.push('l');
    }

Listing 8-17: Adding one character to a `String` value using `push`

As a result, `s` will contain `lol`.

#### Concatenating with `+` or `format!`

Often, you’ll want to combine two existing strings. One way to do so is to use
the `+` operator, as shown in Listing 8-18.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
        let s2 = String::from("world!");
        let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
    }

Listing 8-18: Using the `+` operator to combine two `String` values into a new
`String` value

The string `s3` will contain `Hello, world!`. The reason `s1` is no longer
valid after the addition, and the reason we used a reference to `s2`, has to
do with the signature of the method that’s called when we use the `+`
operator. The `+` operator uses the `add` method, whose signature looks
something like this:

    
    
    fn add(self, s: &str) -> String {

In the standard library, you’ll see `add` defined using generics and
associated types. Here, we’ve substituted in concrete types, which is what
happens when we call this method with `String` values. We’ll discuss generics
in Chapter 10. This signature gives us the clues we need in order to
understand the tricky bits of the `+` operator.

First, `s2` has an `&`, meaning that we’re adding a reference of the second
string to the first string. This is because of the `s` parameter in the `add`
function: We can only add a string slice to a `String`; we can’t add two
`String` values together. But wait—the type of `&s2` is `&String`, not `&str`,
as specified in the second parameter to `add`. So, why does Listing 8-18
compile?

The reason we’re able to use `&s2` in the call to `add` is that the compiler
can coerce the `&String` argument into a `&str`. When we call the `add`
method, Rust uses a deref coercion, which here turns `&s2` into `&s2[..]`.
We’ll discuss deref coercion in more depth in Chapter 15. Because `add` does
not take ownership of the `s` parameter, `s2` will still be a valid `String`
after this operation.

Second, we can see in the signature that `add` takes ownership of `self`
because `self` does _not_ have an `&`. This means `s1` in Listing 8-18 will be
moved into the `add` call and will no longer be valid after that. So, although
`let s3 = s1 + &s2;` looks like it will copy both strings and create a new
one, this statement actually takes ownership of `s1`, appends a copy of the
contents of `s2`, and then returns ownership of the result. In other words, it
looks like it’s making a lot of copies, but it isn’t; the implementation is
more efficient than copying.

If we need to concatenate multiple strings, the behavior of the `+` operator
gets unwieldy:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("tic");
        let s2 = String::from("tac");
        let s3 = String::from("toe");
    
        let s = s1 + "-" + &s2 + "-" + &s3;
    }

At this point, `s` will be `tic-tac-toe`. With all of the `+` and `"`
characters, it’s difficult to see what’s going on. For combining strings in
more complicated ways, we can instead use the `format!` macro:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("tic");
        let s2 = String::from("tac");
        let s3 = String::from("toe");
    
        let s = format!("{s1}-{s2}-{s3}");
    }

This code also sets `s` to `tic-tac-toe`. The `format!` macro works like
`println!`, but instead of printing the output to the screen, it returns a
`String` with the contents. The version of the code using `format!` is much
easier to read, and the code generated by the `format!` macro uses references
so that this call doesn’t take ownership of any of its parameters.

### Indexing into Strings

In many other programming languages, accessing individual characters in a
string by referencing them by index is a valid and common operation. However,
if you try to access parts of a `String` using indexing syntax in Rust, you’ll
get an error. Consider the invalid code in Listing 8-19.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let s1 = String::from("hi");
        let h = s1[0];
    }

Listing 8-19: Attempting to use indexing syntax with a `String`

This code will result in the following error:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0277`.
    error: could not compile `collections` (bin "collections") due to 1 previous error
    

The error tells the story: Rust strings don’t support indexing. But why not?
To answer that question, we need to discuss how Rust stores strings in memory.

#### Internal Representation

A `String` is a wrapper over a `Vec<u8>`. Let’s look at some of our properly
encoded UTF-8 example strings from Listing 8-14. First, this one:

    
    
    fn main() {
        let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
        let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
        let hello = String::from("Hello");
        let hello = String::from("שלום");
        let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
        let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
        let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
        let hello = String::from("你好");
        let hello = String::from("Olá");
        let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
        let hello = String::from("Hola");
    }

In this case, `len` will be `4`, which means the vector storing the string
`"Hola"` is 4 bytes long. Each of these letters takes 1 byte when encoded in
UTF-8. The following line, however, may surprise you (note that this string
begins with the capital Cyrillic letter _Ze_ , not the number 3):

    
    
    fn main() {
        let hello = String::from("السلام عليكم");
        let hello = String::from("Dobrý den");
        let hello = String::from("Hello");
        let hello = String::from("שלום");
        let hello = String::from("नमस्ते");
        let hello = String::from("こんにちは");
        let hello = String::from("안녕하세요");
        let hello = String::from("你好");
        let hello = String::from("Olá");
        let hello = String::from("Здравствуйте");
        let hello = String::from("Hola");
    }

If you were asked how long the string is, you might say 12. In fact, Rust’s
answer is 24: That’s the number of bytes it takes to encode “Здравствуйте” in
UTF-8, because each Unicode scalar value in that string takes 2 bytes of
storage. Therefore, an index into the string’s bytes will not always correlate
to a valid Unicode scalar value. To demonstrate, consider this invalid Rust
code:

    
    
    let hello = "Здравствуйте";
    let answer = &hello[0];

You already know that `answer` will not be `З`, the first letter. When encoded
in UTF-8, the first byte of `З` is `208` and the second is `151`, so it would
seem that `answer` should in fact be `208`, but `208` is not a valid character
on its own. Returning `208` is likely not what a user would want if they asked
for the first letter of this string; however, that’s the only data that Rust
has at byte index 0. Users generally don’t want the byte value returned, even
if the string contains only Latin letters: If `&"hi"[0]` were valid code that
returned the byte value, it would return `104`, not `h`.

The answer, then, is that to avoid returning an unexpected value and causing
bugs that might not be discovered immediately, Rust doesn’t compile this code
at all and prevents misunderstandings early in the development process.

#### Bytes, Scalar Values, and Grapheme Clusters

Another point about UTF-8 is that there are actually three relevant ways to
look at strings from Rust’s perspective: as bytes, scalar values, and grapheme
clusters (the closest thing to what we would call _letters_).

If we look at the Hindi word “नमस्ते” written in the Devanagari script, it is
stored as a vector of `u8` values that looks like this:

    
    
    [224, 164, 168, 224, 164, 174, 224, 164, 184, 224, 165, 141, 224, 164, 164,
    224, 165, 135]
    

That’s 18 bytes and is how computers ultimately store this data. If we look at
them as Unicode scalar values, which are what Rust’s `char` type is, those
bytes look like this:

    
    
    ['न', 'म', 'स', '्', 'त', 'े']
    

There are six `char` values here, but the fourth and sixth are not letters:
They’re diacritics that don’t make sense on their own. Finally, if we look at
them as grapheme clusters, we’d get what a person would call the four letters
that make up the Hindi word:

    
    
    ["न", "म", "स्", "ते"]
    

Rust provides different ways of interpreting the raw string data that
computers store so that each program can choose the interpretation it needs,
no matter what human language the data is in.

A final reason Rust doesn’t allow us to index into a `String` to get a
character is that indexing operations are expected to always take constant
time (O(1)). But it isn’t possible to guarantee that performance with a
`String`, because Rust would have to walk through the contents from the
beginning to the index to determine how many valid characters there were.

### Slicing Strings

Indexing into a string is often a bad idea because it’s not clear what the
return type of the string-indexing operation should be: a byte value, a
character, a grapheme cluster, or a string slice. If you really need to use
indices to create string slices, therefore, Rust asks you to be more specific.

Rather than indexing using `[]` with a single number, you can use `[]` with a
range to create a string slice containing particular bytes:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let hello = "Здравствуйте";
    
    let s = &hello[0..4];
    }

Here, `s` will be a `&str` that contains the first 4 bytes of the string.
Earlier, we mentioned that each of these characters was 2 bytes, which means
`s` will be `Зд`.

If we were to try to slice only part of a character’s bytes with something
like `&hello[0..1]`, Rust would panic at runtime in the same way as if an
invalid index were accessed in a vector:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling collections v0.1.0 (file:///projects/collections)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.43s
         Running `target/debug/collections`
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:19:
    byte index 1 is not a char boundary; it is inside 'З' (bytes 0..2) of `Здравствуйте`
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    

You should use caution when creating string slices with ranges, because doing
so can crash your program.

### Iterating Over Strings

The best way to operate on pieces of strings is to be explicit about whether
you want characters or bytes. For individual Unicode scalar values, use the
`chars` method. Calling `chars` on “Зд” separates out and returns two values
of type `char`, and you can iterate over the result to access each element:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    for c in "Зд".chars() {
        println!("{c}");
    }
    }

This code will print the following:

    
    
    З
    д
    

Alternatively, the `bytes` method returns each raw byte, which might be
appropriate for your domain:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    for b in "Зд".bytes() {
        println!("{b}");
    }
    }

This code will print the 4 bytes that make up this string:

    
    
    208
    151
    208
    180
    

But be sure to remember that valid Unicode scalar values may be made up of
more than 1 byte.

Getting grapheme clusters from strings, as with the Devanagari script, is
complex, so this functionality is not provided by the standard library. Crates
are available on [crates.io](https://crates.io/) if this is the functionality
you need.

### Handling the Complexities of Strings

To summarize, strings are complicated. Different programming languages make
different choices about how to present this complexity to the programmer. Rust
has chosen to make the correct handling of `String` data the default behavior
for all Rust programs, which means programmers have to put more thought into
handling UTF-8 data up front. This trade-off exposes more of the complexity of
strings than is apparent in other programming languages, but it prevents you
from having to handle errors involving non-ASCII characters later in your
development life cycle.

The good news is that the standard library offers a lot of functionality built
off the `String` and `&str` types to help handle these complex situations
correctly. Be sure to check out the documentation for useful methods like
`contains` for searching in a string and `replace` for substituting parts of a
string with another string.

Let’s switch to something a bit less complex: hash maps!

# Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

## Storing Keys with Associated Values in Hash Maps

The last of our common collections is the hash map. The type `HashMap<K, V>`
stores a mapping of keys of type `K` to values of type `V` using a _hashing
function_ , which determines how it places these keys and values into memory.
Many programming languages support this kind of data structure, but they often
use a different name, such as _hash_ , _map_ , _object_ , _hash table_ ,
_dictionary_ , or _associative array_ , just to name a few.

Hash maps are useful when you want to look up data not by using an index, as
you can with vectors, but by using a key that can be of any type. For example,
in a game, you could keep track of each team’s score in a hash map in which
each key is a team’s name and the values are each team’s score. Given a team
name, you can retrieve its score.

We’ll go over the basic API of hash maps in this section, but many more
goodies are hiding in the functions defined on `HashMap<K, V>` by the standard
library. As always, check the standard library documentation for more
information.

### Creating a New Hash Map

One way to create an empty hash map is to use `new` and to add elements with
`insert`. In Listing 8-20, we’re keeping track of the scores of two teams
whose names are _Blue_ and _Yellow_. The Blue team starts with 10 points, and
the Yellow team starts with 50.

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    
        scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
        scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
    }

Listing 8-20: Creating a new hash map and inserting some keys and values

Note that we need to first `use` the `HashMap` from the collections portion of
the standard library. Of our three common collections, this one is the least
often used, so it’s not included in the features brought into scope
automatically in the prelude. Hash maps also have less support from the
standard library; there’s no built-in macro to construct them, for example.

Just like vectors, hash maps store their data on the heap. This `HashMap` has
keys of type `String` and values of type `i32`. Like vectors, hash maps are
homogeneous: All of the keys must have the same type, and all of the values
must have the same type.

### Accessing Values in a Hash Map

We can get a value out of the hash map by providing its key to the `get`
method, as shown in Listing 8-21.

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    
        scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
        scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
    
        let team_name = String::from("Blue");
        let score = scores.get(&team_name).copied().unwrap_or(0);
    }

Listing 8-21: Accessing the score for the Blue team stored in the hash map

Here, `score` will have the value that’s associated with the Blue team, and
the result will be `10`. The `get` method returns an `Option<&V>`; if there’s
no value for that key in the hash map, `get` will return `None`. This program
handles the `Option` by calling `copied` to get an `Option<i32>` rather than
an `Option<&i32>`, then `unwrap_or` to set `score` to zero if `scores` doesn’t
have an entry for the key.

We can iterate over each key-value pair in a hash map in a similar manner as
we do with vectors, using a `for` loop:

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    
        scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
        scores.insert(String::from("Yellow"), 50);
    
        for (key, value) in &scores {
            println!("{key}: {value}");
        }
    }

This code will print each pair in an arbitrary order:

    
    
    Yellow: 50
    Blue: 10
    

### Managing Ownership in Hash Maps

For types that implement the `Copy` trait, like `i32`, the values are copied
into the hash map. For owned values like `String`, the values will be moved
and the hash map will be the owner of those values, as demonstrated in Listing
8-22.

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let field_name = String::from("Favorite color");
        let field_value = String::from("Blue");
    
        let mut map = HashMap::new();
        map.insert(field_name, field_value);
        // field_name and field_value are invalid at this point, try using them and
        // see what compiler error you get!
    }

Listing 8-22: Showing that keys and values are owned by the hash map once
they’re inserted

We aren’t able to use the variables `field_name` and `field_value` after
they’ve been moved into the hash map with the call to `insert`.

If we insert references to values into the hash map, the values won’t be moved
into the hash map. The values that the references point to must be valid for
at least as long as the hash map is valid. We’ll talk more about these issues
in “Validating References with Lifetimes” in Chapter 10.

### Updating a Hash Map

Although the number of key and value pairs is growable, each unique key can
only have one value associated with it at a time (but not vice versa: For
example, both the Blue team and the Yellow team could have the value `10`
stored in the `scores` hash map).

When you want to change the data in a hash map, you have to decide how to
handle the case when a key already has a value assigned. You could replace the
old value with the new value, completely disregarding the old value. You could
keep the old value and ignore the new value, only adding the new value if the
key _doesn’t_ already have a value. Or you could combine the old value and the
new value. Let’s look at how to do each of these!

#### Overwriting a Value

If we insert a key and a value into a hash map and then insert that same key
with a different value, the value associated with that key will be replaced.
Even though the code in Listing 8-23 calls `insert` twice, the hash map will
only contain one key-value pair because we’re inserting the value for the Blue
team’s key both times.

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let mut scores = HashMap::new();
    
        scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
        scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 25);
    
        println!("{scores:?}");
    }

Listing 8-23: Replacing a value stored with a particular key

This code will print `{"Blue": 25}`. The original value of `10` has been
overwritten.

#### Adding a Key and Value Only If a Key Isn’t Present

It’s common to check whether a particular key already exists in the hash map
with a value and then to take the following actions: If the key does exist in
the hash map, the existing value should remain the way it is; if the key
doesn’t exist, insert it and a value for it.

Hash maps have a special API for this called `entry` that takes the key you
want to check as a parameter. The return value of the `entry` method is an
enum called `Entry` that represents a value that might or might not exist.
Let’s say we want to check whether the key for the Yellow team has a value
associated with it. If it doesn’t, we want to insert the value `50`, and the
same for the Blue team. Using the `entry` API, the code looks like Listing
8-24.

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let mut scores = HashMap::new();
        scores.insert(String::from("Blue"), 10);
    
        scores.entry(String::from("Yellow")).or_insert(50);
        scores.entry(String::from("Blue")).or_insert(50);
    
        println!("{scores:?}");
    }

Listing 8-24: Using the `entry` method to only insert if the key does not
already have a value

The `or_insert` method on `Entry` is defined to return a mutable reference to
the value for the corresponding `Entry` key if that key exists, and if not, it
inserts the parameter as the new value for this key and returns a mutable
reference to the new value. This technique is much cleaner than writing the
logic ourselves and, in addition, plays more nicely with the borrow checker.

Running the code in Listing 8-24 will print `{"Yellow": 50, "Blue": 10}`. The
first call to `entry` will insert the key for the Yellow team with the value
`50` because the Yellow team doesn’t have a value already. The second call to
`entry` will not change the hash map, because the Blue team already has the
value `10`.

#### Updating a Value Based on the Old Value

Another common use case for hash maps is to look up a key’s value and then
update it based on the old value. For instance, Listing 8-25 shows code that
counts how many times each word appears in some text. We use a hash map with
the words as keys and increment the value to keep track of how many times
we’ve seen that word. If it’s the first time we’ve seen a word, we’ll first
insert the value `0`.

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::collections::HashMap;
    
        let text = "hello world wonderful world";
    
        let mut map = HashMap::new();
    
        for word in text.split_whitespace() {
            let count = map.entry(word).or_insert(0);
            *count += 1;
        }
    
        println!("{map:?}");
    }

Listing 8-25: Counting occurrences of words using a hash map that stores words
and counts

This code will print `{"world": 2, "hello": 1, "wonderful": 1}`. You might see
the same key-value pairs printed in a different order: Recall from “Accessing
Values in a Hash Map” that iterating over a hash map happens in an arbitrary
order.

The `split_whitespace` method returns an iterator over subslices, separated by
whitespace, of the value in `text`. The `or_insert` method returns a mutable
reference (`&mut V`) to the value for the specified key. Here, we store that
mutable reference in the `count` variable, so in order to assign to that
value, we must first dereference `count` using the asterisk (`*`). The mutable
reference goes out of scope at the end of the `for` loop, so all of these
changes are safe and allowed by the borrowing rules.

### Hashing Functions

By default, `HashMap` uses a hashing function called _SipHash_ that can
provide resistance to denial-of-service (DoS) attacks involving hash tables1.
This is not the fastest hashing algorithm available, but the trade-off for
better security that comes with the drop in performance is worth it. If you
profile your code and find that the default hash function is too slow for your
purposes, you can switch to another function by specifying a different hasher.
A _hasher_ is a type that implements the `BuildHasher` trait. We’ll talk about
traits and how to implement them in Chapter 10. You don’t necessarily have to
implement your own hasher from scratch; [crates.io](https://crates.io/) has
libraries shared by other Rust users that provide hashers implementing many
common hashing algorithms.

## Summary

Vectors, strings, and hash maps will provide a large amount of functionality
necessary in programs when you need to store, access, and modify data. Here
are some exercises you should now be equipped to solve:

  1. Given a list of integers, use a vector and return the median (when sorted, the value in the middle position) and mode (the value that occurs most often; a hash map will be helpful here) of the list.
  2. Convert strings to Pig Latin. The first consonant of each word is moved to the end of the word and _ay_ is added, so _first_ becomes _irst-fay_. Words that start with a vowel have _hay_ added to the end instead (_apple_ becomes _apple-hay_). Keep in mind the details about UTF-8 encoding!
  3. Using a hash map and vectors, create a text interface to allow a user to add employee names to a department in a company; for example, “Add Sally to Engineering” or “Add Amir to Sales.” Then, let the user retrieve a list of all people in a department or all people in the company by department, sorted alphabetically.

The standard library API documentation describes methods that vectors,
strings, and hash maps have that will be helpful for these exercises!

We’re getting into more complex programs in which operations can fail, so it’s
a perfect time to discuss error handling. We’ll do that next!

# Error Handling

Errors are a fact of life in software, so Rust has a number of features for
handling situations in which something goes wrong. In many cases, Rust
requires you to acknowledge the possibility of an error and take some action
before your code will compile. This requirement makes your program more robust
by ensuring that you’ll discover errors and handle them appropriately before
deploying your code to production!

Rust groups errors into two major categories: recoverable and unrecoverable
errors. For a _recoverable error_ , such as a _file not found_ error, we most
likely just want to report the problem to the user and retry the operation.
_Unrecoverable errors_ are always symptoms of bugs, such as trying to access a
location beyond the end of an array, and so we want to immediately stop the
program.

Most languages don’t distinguish between these two kinds of errors and handle
both in the same way, using mechanisms such as exceptions. Rust doesn’t have
exceptions. Instead, it has the type `Result<T, E>` for recoverable errors and
the `panic!` macro that stops execution when the program encounters an
unrecoverable error. This chapter covers calling `panic!` first and then talks
about returning `Result<T, E>` values. Additionally, we’ll explore
considerations when deciding whether to try to recover from an error or to
stop execution.

# Unrecoverable Errors with panic!

## Unrecoverable Errors with `panic!`

Sometimes bad things happen in your code, and there’s nothing you can do about
it. In these cases, Rust has the `panic!` macro. There are two ways to cause a
panic in practice: by taking an action that causes our code to panic (such as
accessing an array past the end) or by explicitly calling the `panic!` macro.
In both cases, we cause a panic in our program. By default, these panics will
print a failure message, unwind, clean up the stack, and quit. Via an
environment variable, you can also have Rust display the call stack when a
panic occurs to make it easier to track down the source of the panic.

### Unwinding the Stack or Aborting in Response to a Panic

By default, when a panic occurs, the program starts _unwinding_ , which means
Rust walks back up the stack and cleans up the data from each function it
encounters. However, walking back and cleaning up is a lot of work. Rust
therefore allows you to choose the alternative of immediately _aborting_ ,
which ends the program without cleaning up.

Memory that the program was using will then need to be cleaned up by the
operating system. If in your project you need to make the resultant binary as
small as possible, you can switch from unwinding to aborting upon a panic by
adding `panic = 'abort'` to the appropriate `[profile]` sections in your
_Cargo.toml_ file. For example, if you want to abort on panic in release mode,
add this:

    
    
    [profile.release]
    panic = 'abort'
    

Let’s try calling `panic!` in a simple program:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        panic!("crash and burn");
    }

When you run the program, you’ll see something like this:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.25s
         Running `target/debug/panic`
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:2:5:
    crash and burn
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    

The call to `panic!` causes the error message contained in the last two lines.
The first line shows our panic message and the place in our source code where
the panic occurred: _src/main.rs:2:5_ indicates that it’s the second line,
fifth character of our _src/main.rs_ file.

In this case, the line indicated is part of our code, and if we go to that
line, we see the `panic!` macro call. In other cases, the `panic!` call might
be in code that our code calls, and the filename and line number reported by
the error message will be someone else’s code where the `panic!` macro is
called, not the line of our code that eventually led to the `panic!` call.

We can use the backtrace of the functions the `panic!` call came from to
figure out the part of our code that is causing the problem. To understand how
to use a `panic!` backtrace, let’s look at another example and see what it’s
like when a `panic!` call comes from a library because of a bug in our code
instead of from our code calling the macro directly. Listing 9-1 has some code
that attempts to access an index in a vector beyond the range of valid
indexes.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let v = vec![1, 2, 3];
    
        v[99];
    }

Listing 9-1: Attempting to access an element beyond the end of a vector, which
will cause a call to `panic!`

Here, we’re attempting to access the 100th element of our vector (which is at
index 99 because indexing starts at zero), but the vector has only three
elements. In this situation, Rust will panic. Using `[]` is supposed to return
an element, but if you pass an invalid index, there’s no element that Rust
could return here that would be correct.

In C, attempting to read beyond the end of a data structure is undefined
behavior. You might get whatever is at the location in memory that would
correspond to that element in the data structure, even though the memory
doesn’t belong to that structure. This is called a _buffer overread_ and can
lead to security vulnerabilities if an attacker is able to manipulate the
index in such a way as to read data they shouldn’t be allowed to that is
stored after the data structure.

To protect your program from this sort of vulnerability, if you try to read an
element at an index that doesn’t exist, Rust will stop execution and refuse to
continue. Let’s try it and see:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling panic v0.1.0 (file:///projects/panic)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.27s
         Running `target/debug/panic`
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:
    index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    

This error points at line 4 of our _main.rs_ where we attempt to access index
99 of the vector in `v`.

The `note:` line tells us that we can set the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment
variable to get a backtrace of exactly what happened to cause the error. A
_backtrace_ is a list of all the functions that have been called to get to
this point. Backtraces in Rust work as they do in other languages: The key to
reading the backtrace is to start from the top and read until you see files
you wrote. That’s the spot where the problem originated. The lines above that
spot are code that your code has called; the lines below are code that called
your code. These before-and-after lines might include core Rust code, standard
library code, or crates that you’re using. Let’s try to get a backtrace by
setting the `RUST_BACKTRACE` environment variable to any value except `0`.
Listing 9-2 shows output similar to what you’ll see.

    
    
    $ RUST_BACKTRACE=1 cargo run
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:6:
    index out of bounds: the len is 3 but the index is 99

Listing 9-2: The backtrace generated by a call to `panic!` displayed when the
environment variable `RUST_BACKTRACE` is set

That’s a lot of output! The exact output you see might be different depending
on your operating system and Rust version. In order to get backtraces with
this information, debug symbols must be enabled. Debug symbols are enabled by
default when using `cargo build` or `cargo run` without the `--release` flag,
as we have here.

In the output in Listing 9-2, line 6 of the backtrace points to the line in
our project that’s causing the problem: line 4 of _src/main.rs_. If we don’t
want our program to panic, we should start our investigation at the location
pointed to by the first line mentioning a file we wrote. In Listing 9-1, where
we deliberately wrote code that would panic, the way to fix the panic is to
not request an element beyond the range of the vector indexes. When your code
panics in the future, you’ll need to figure out what action the code is taking
with what values to cause the panic and what the code should do instead.

We’ll come back to `panic!` and when we should and should not use `panic!` to
handle error conditions in the “To `panic!` or Not to `panic!`” section later
in this chapter. Next, we’ll look at how to recover from an error using
`Result`.

# Recoverable Errors with Result

## Recoverable Errors with `Result`

Most errors aren’t serious enough to require the program to stop entirely.
Sometimes when a function fails, it’s for a reason that you can easily
interpret and respond to. For example, if you try to open a file and that
operation fails because the file doesn’t exist, you might want to create the
file instead of terminating the process.

Recall from “Handling Potential Failure with `Result`” in Chapter 2 that the
`Result` enum is defined as having two variants, `Ok` and `Err`, as follows:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    enum Result<T, E> {
        Ok(T),
        Err(E),
    }
    }

The `T` and `E` are generic type parameters: We’ll discuss generics in more
detail in Chapter 10. What you need to know right now is that `T` represents
the type of the value that will be returned in a success case within the `Ok`
variant, and `E` represents the type of the error that will be returned in a
failure case within the `Err` variant. Because `Result` has these generic type
parameters, we can use the `Result` type and the functions defined on it in
many different situations where the success value and error value we want to
return may differ.

Let’s call a function that returns a `Result` value because the function could
fail. In Listing 9-3, we try to open a file.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
    }

Listing 9-3: Opening a file

The return type of `File::open` is a `Result<T, E>`. The generic parameter `T`
has been filled in by the implementation of `File::open` with the type of the
success value, `std::fs::File`, which is a file handle. The type of `E` used
in the error value is `std::io::Error`. This return type means the call to
`File::open` might succeed and return a file handle that we can read from or
write to. The function call also might fail: For example, the file might not
exist, or we might not have permission to access the file. The `File::open`
function needs to have a way to tell us whether it succeeded or failed and at
the same time give us either the file handle or error information. This
information is exactly what the `Result` enum conveys.

In the case where `File::open` succeeds, the value in the variable
`greeting_file_result` will be an instance of `Ok` that contains a file
handle. In the case where it fails, the value in `greeting_file_result` will
be an instance of `Err` that contains more information about the kind of error
that occurred.

We need to add to the code in Listing 9-3 to take different actions depending
on the value `File::open` returns. Listing 9-4 shows one way to handle the
`Result` using a basic tool, the `match` expression that we discussed in
Chapter 6.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
    
        let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
            Ok(file) => file,
            Err(error) => panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}"),
        };
    }

Listing 9-4: Using a `match` expression to handle the `Result` variants that
might be returned

Note that, like the `Option` enum, the `Result` enum and its variants have
been brought into scope by the prelude, so we don’t need to specify `Result::`
before the `Ok` and `Err` variants in the `match` arms.

When the result is `Ok`, this code will return the inner `file` value out of
the `Ok` variant, and we then assign that file handle value to the variable
`greeting_file`. After the `match`, we can use the file handle for reading or
writing.

The other arm of the `match` handles the case where we get an `Err` value from
`File::open`. In this example, we’ve chosen to call the `panic!` macro. If
there’s no file named _hello.txt_ in our current directory and we run this
code, we’ll see the following output from the `panic!` macro:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling error-handling v0.1.0 (file:///projects/error-handling)
        Finished `dev` profile [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.73s
         Running `target/debug/error-handling`
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:8:23:
    Problem opening the file: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
    note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
    

As usual, this output tells us exactly what has gone wrong.

### Matching on Different Errors

The code in Listing 9-4 will `panic!` no matter why `File::open` failed.
However, we want to take different actions for different failure reasons. If
`File::open` failed because the file doesn’t exist, we want to create the file
and return the handle to the new file. If `File::open` failed for any other
reason—for example, because we didn’t have permission to open the file—we
still want the code to `panic!` in the same way it did in Listing 9-4. For
this, we add an inner `match` expression, shown in Listing 9-5.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::ErrorKind;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
    
        let greeting_file = match greeting_file_result {
            Ok(file) => file,
            Err(error) => match error.kind() {
                ErrorKind::NotFound => match File::create("hello.txt") {
                    Ok(fc) => fc,
                    Err(e) => panic!("Problem creating the file: {e:?}"),
                },
                _ => {
                    panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}");
                }
            },
        };
    }

Listing 9-5: Handling different kinds of errors in different ways

The type of the value that `File::open` returns inside the `Err` variant is
`io::Error`, which is a struct provided by the standard library. This struct
has a method, `kind`, that we can call to get an `io::ErrorKind` value. The
enum `io::ErrorKind` is provided by the standard library and has variants
representing the different kinds of errors that might result from an `io`
operation. The variant we want to use is `ErrorKind::NotFound`, which
indicates the file we’re trying to open doesn’t exist yet. So, we match on
`greeting_file_result`, but we also have an inner match on `error.kind()`.

The condition we want to check in the inner match is whether the value
returned by `error.kind()` is the `NotFound` variant of the `ErrorKind` enum.
If it is, we try to create the file with `File::create`. However, because
`File::create` could also fail, we need a second arm in the inner `match`
expression. When the file can’t be created, a different error message is
printed. The second arm of the outer `match` stays the same, so the program
panics on any error besides the missing file error.

#### Alternatives to Using `match` with `Result<T, E>`

That’s a lot of `match`! The `match` expression is very useful but also very
much a primitive. In Chapter 13, you’ll learn about closures, which are used
with many of the methods defined on `Result<T, E>`. These methods can be more
concise than using `match` when handling `Result<T, E>` values in your code.

For example, here’s another way to write the same logic as shown in Listing
9-5, this time using closures and the `unwrap_or_else` method:

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::ErrorKind;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
            if error.kind() == ErrorKind::NotFound {
                File::create("hello.txt").unwrap_or_else(|error| {
                    panic!("Problem creating the file: {error:?}");
                })
            } else {
                panic!("Problem opening the file: {error:?}");
            }
        });
    }

Although this code has the same behavior as Listing 9-5, it doesn’t contain
any `match` expressions and is cleaner to read. Come back to this example
after you’ve read Chapter 13 and look up the `unwrap_or_else` method in the
standard library documentation. Many more of these methods can clean up huge,
nested `match` expressions when you’re dealing with errors.

#### Shortcuts for Panic on Error

Using `match` works well enough, but it can be a bit verbose and doesn’t
always communicate intent well. The `Result<T, E>` type has many helper
methods defined on it to do various, more specific tasks. The `unwrap` method
is a shortcut method implemented just like the `match` expression we wrote in
Listing 9-4. If the `Result` value is the `Ok` variant, `unwrap` will return
the value inside the `Ok`. If the `Result` is the `Err` variant, `unwrap` will
call the `panic!` macro for us. Here is an example of `unwrap` in action:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt").unwrap();
    }

If we run this code without a _hello.txt_ file, we’ll see an error message
from the `panic!` call that the `unwrap` method makes:

    
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:4:49:
    called `Result::unwrap()` on an `Err` value: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
    

Similarly, the `expect` method lets us also choose the `panic!` error message.
Using `expect` instead of `unwrap` and providing good error messages can
convey your intent and make tracking down the source of a panic easier. The
syntax of `expect` looks like this:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")
            .expect("hello.txt should be included in this project");
    }

We use `expect` in the same way as `unwrap`: to return the file handle or call
the `panic!` macro. The error message used by `expect` in its call to `panic!`
will be the parameter that we pass to `expect`, rather than the default
`panic!` message that `unwrap` uses. Here’s what it looks like:

    
    
    thread 'main' panicked at src/main.rs:5:10:
    hello.txt should be included in this project: Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "No such file or directory" }
    

In production-quality code, most Rustaceans choose `expect` rather than
`unwrap` and give more context about why the operation is expected to always
succeed. That way, if your assumptions are ever proven wrong, you have more
information to use in debugging.

### Propagating Errors

When a function’s implementation calls something that might fail, instead of
handling the error within the function itself, you can return the error to the
calling code so that it can decide what to do. This is known as _propagating_
the error and gives more control to the calling code, where there might be
more information or logic that dictates how the error should be handled than
what you have available in the context of your code.

For example, Listing 9-6 shows a function that reads a username from a file.
If the file doesn’t exist or can’t be read, this function will return those
errors to the code that called the function.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::{self, Read};
    
    fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
        let username_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
    
        let mut username_file = match username_file_result {
            Ok(file) => file,
            Err(e) => return Err(e),
        };
    
        let mut username = String::new();
    
        match username_file.read_to_string(&mut username) {
            Ok(_) => Ok(username),
            Err(e) => Err(e),
        }
    }
    }

Listing 9-6: A function that returns errors to the calling code using `match`

This function can be written in a much shorter way, but we’re going to start
by doing a lot of it manually in order to explore error handling; at the end,
we’ll show the shorter way. Let’s look at the return type of the function
first: `Result<String, io::Error>`. This means the function is returning a
value of the type `Result<T, E>`, where the generic parameter `T` has been
filled in with the concrete type `String` and the generic type `E` has been
filled in with the concrete type `io::Error`.

If this function succeeds without any problems, the code that calls this
function will receive an `Ok` value that holds a `String`—the `username` that
this function read from the file. If this function encounters any problems,
the calling code will receive an `Err` value that holds an instance of
`io::Error` that contains more information about what the problems were. We
chose `io::Error` as the return type of this function because that happens to
be the type of the error value returned from both of the operations we’re
calling in this function’s body that might fail: the `File::open` function and
the `read_to_string` method.

The body of the function starts by calling the `File::open` function. Then, we
handle the `Result` value with a `match` similar to the `match` in Listing
9-4. If `File::open` succeeds, the file handle in the pattern variable `file`
becomes the value in the mutable variable `username_file` and the function
continues. In the `Err` case, instead of calling `panic!`, we use the `return`
keyword to return early out of the function entirely and pass the error value
from `File::open`, now in the pattern variable `e`, back to the calling code
as this function’s error value.

So, if we have a file handle in `username_file`, the function then creates a
new `String` in variable `username` and calls the `read_to_string` method on
the file handle in `username_file` to read the contents of the file into
`username`. The `read_to_string` method also returns a `Result` because it
might fail, even though `File::open` succeeded. So, we need another `match` to
handle that `Result`: If `read_to_string` succeeds, then our function has
succeeded, and we return the username from the file that’s now in `username`
wrapped in an `Ok`. If `read_to_string` fails, we return the error value in
the same way that we returned the error value in the `match` that handled the
return value of `File::open`. However, we don’t need to explicitly say
`return`, because this is the last expression in the function.

The code that calls this code will then handle getting either an `Ok` value
that contains a username or an `Err` value that contains an `io::Error`. It’s
up to the calling code to decide what to do with those values. If the calling
code gets an `Err` value, it could call `panic!` and crash the program, use a
default username, or look up the username from somewhere other than a file,
for example. We don’t have enough information on what the calling code is
actually trying to do, so we propagate all the success or error information
upward for it to handle appropriately.

This pattern of propagating errors is so common in Rust that Rust provides the
question mark operator `?` to make this easier.

#### The `?` Operator Shortcut

Listing 9-7 shows an implementation of `read_username_from_file` that has the
same functionality as in Listing 9-6, but this implementation uses the `?`
operator.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::{self, Read};
    
    fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
        let mut username_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
        let mut username = String::new();
        username_file.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
        Ok(username)
    }
    }

Listing 9-7: A function that returns errors to the calling code using the `?`
operator

The `?` placed after a `Result` value is defined to work in almost the same
way as the `match` expressions that we defined to handle the `Result` values
in Listing 9-6. If the value of the `Result` is an `Ok`, the value inside the
`Ok` will get returned from this expression, and the program will continue. If
the value is an `Err`, the `Err` will be returned from the whole function as
if we had used the `return` keyword so that the error value gets propagated to
the calling code.

There is a difference between what the `match` expression from Listing 9-6
does and what the `?` operator does: Error values that have the `?` operator
called on them go through the `from` function, defined in the `From` trait in
the standard library, which is used to convert values from one type into
another. When the `?` operator calls the `from` function, the error type
received is converted into the error type defined in the return type of the
current function. This is useful when a function returns one error type to
represent all the ways a function might fail, even if parts might fail for
many different reasons.

For example, we could change the `read_username_from_file` function in Listing
9-7 to return a custom error type named `OurError` that we define. If we also
define `impl From<io::Error> for OurError` to construct an instance of
`OurError` from an `io::Error`, then the `?` operator calls in the body of
`read_username_from_file` will call `from` and convert the error types without
needing to add any more code to the function.

In the context of Listing 9-7, the `?` at the end of the `File::open` call
will return the value inside an `Ok` to the variable `username_file`. If an
error occurs, the `?` operator will return early out of the whole function and
give any `Err` value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the `?` at
the end of the `read_to_string` call.

The `?` operator eliminates a lot of boilerplate and makes this function’s
implementation simpler. We could even shorten this code further by chaining
method calls immediately after the `?`, as shown in Listing 9-8.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use std::fs::File;
    use std::io::{self, Read};
    
    fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
        let mut username = String::new();
    
        File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;
    
        Ok(username)
    }
    }

Listing 9-8: Chaining method calls after the `?` operator

We’ve moved the creation of the new `String` in `username` to the beginning of
the function; that part hasn’t changed. Instead of creating a variable
`username_file`, we’ve chained the call to `read_to_string` directly onto the
result of `File::open("hello.txt")?`. We still have a `?` at the end of the
`read_to_string` call, and we still return an `Ok` value containing `username`
when both `File::open` and `read_to_string` succeed rather than returning
errors. The functionality is again the same as in Listing 9-6 and Listing 9-7;
this is just a different, more ergonomic way to write it.

Listing 9-9 shows a way to make this even shorter using `fs::read_to_string`.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    use std::fs;
    use std::io;
    
    fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
        fs::read_to_string("hello.txt")
    }
    }

Listing 9-9: Using `fs::read_to_string` instead of opening and then reading
the file

Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard
library provides the convenient `fs::read_to_string` function that opens the
file, creates a new `String`, reads the contents of the file, puts the
contents into that `String`, and returns it. Of course, using
`fs::read_to_string` doesn’t give us the opportunity to explain all the error
handling, so we did it the longer way first.

#### Where to Use the `?` Operator

The `?` operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible
with the value the `?` is used on. This is because the `?` operator is defined
to perform an early return of a value out of the function, in the same manner
as the `match` expression we defined in Listing 9-6. In Listing 9-6, the
`match` was using a `Result` value, and the early return arm returned an
`Err(e)` value. The return type of the function has to be a `Result` so that
it’s compatible with this `return`.

In Listing 9-10, let’s look at the error we’ll get if we use the `?` operator
in a `main` function with a return type that is incompatible with the type of
the value we use `?` on.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::fs::File;
    
    fn main() {
        let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    }

Listing 9-10: Attempting to use the `?` in the `main` function that returns
`()` won’t compile.

This code opens a file, which might fail. The `?` operator follows the
`Result` value returned by `File::open`, but this `main` function has the
return type of `()`, not `Result`. When we compile this code, we get the
following error message:

    
    
    $ cargo run

This error points out that we’re only allowed to use the `?` operator in a
function that returns `Result`, `Option`, or another type that implements
`FromResidual`.

To fix the error, you have two choices. One choice is to change the return
type of your function to be compatible with the value you’re using the `?`
operator on as long as you have no restrictions preventing that. The other
choice is to use a `match` or one of the `Result<T, E>` methods to handle the
`Result<T, E>` in whatever way is appropriate.

The error message also mentioned that `?` can be used with `Option<T>` values
as well. As with using `?` on `Result`, you can only use `?` on `Option` in a
function that returns an `Option`. The behavior of the `?` operator when
called on an `Option<T>` is similar to its behavior when called on a
`Result<T, E>`: If the value is `None`, the `None` will be returned early from
the function at that point. If the value is `Some`, the value inside the
`Some` is the resultant value of the expression, and the function continues.
Listing 9-11 has an example of a function that finds the last character of the
first line in the given text.

    
    
    fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &str) -> Option<char> {
        text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
    }
    
    fn main() {
        assert_eq!(
            last_char_of_first_line("Hello, world\nHow are you today?"),
            Some('d')
        );
    
        assert_eq!(last_char_of_first_line(""), None);
        assert_eq!(last_char_of_first_line("\nhi"), None);
    }

Listing 9-11: Using the `?` operator on an `Option<T>` value

This function returns `Option<char>` because it’s possible that there is a
character there, but it’s also possible that there isn’t. This code takes the
`text` string slice argument and calls the `lines` method on it, which returns
an iterator over the lines in the string. Because this function wants to
examine the first line, it calls `next` on the iterator to get the first value
from the iterator. If `text` is the empty string, this call to `next` will
return `None`, in which case we use `?` to stop and return `None` from
`last_char_of_first_line`. If `text` is not the empty string, `next` will
return a `Some` value containing a string slice of the first line in `text`.

The `?` extracts the string slice, and we can call `chars` on that string
slice to get an iterator of its characters. We’re interested in the last
character in this first line, so we call `last` to return the last item in the
iterator. This is an `Option` because it’s possible that the first line is the
empty string; for example, if `text` starts with a blank line but has
characters on other lines, as in `"\nhi"`. However, if there is a last
character on the first line, it will be returned in the `Some` variant. The
`?` operator in the middle gives us a concise way to express this logic,
allowing us to implement the function in one line. If we couldn’t use the `?`
operator on `Option`, we’d have to implement this logic using more method
calls or a `match` expression.

Note that you can use the `?` operator on a `Result` in a function that
returns `Result`, and you can use the `?` operator on an `Option` in a
function that returns `Option`, but you can’t mix and match. The `?` operator
won’t automatically convert a `Result` to an `Option` or vice versa; in those
cases, you can use methods like the `ok` method on `Result` or the `ok_or`
method on `Option` to do the conversion explicitly.

So far, all the `main` functions we’ve used return `()`. The `main` function
is special because it’s the entry point and exit point of an executable
program, and there are restrictions on what its return type can be for the
program to behave as expected.

Luckily, `main` can also return a `Result<(), E>`. Listing 9-12 has the code
from Listing 9-10, but we’ve changed the return type of `main` to be
`Result<(), Box<dyn Error>>` and added a return value `Ok(())` to the end.
This code will now compile.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use std::error::Error;
    use std::fs::File;
    
    fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn Error>> {
        let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
    
        Ok(())
    }

Listing 9-12: Changing `main` to return `Result<(), E>` allows the use of the
`?` operator on `Result` values.

The `Box<dyn Error>` type is a trait object, which we’ll talk about in “Using
Trait Objects to Abstract over Shared Behavior” in Chapter 18. For now, you
can read `Box<dyn Error>` to mean “any kind of error.” Using `?` on a `Result`
value in a `main` function with the error type `Box<dyn Error>` is allowed
because it allows any `Err` value to be returned early. Even though the body
of this `main` function will only ever return errors of type `std::io::Error`,
by specifying `Box<dyn Error>`, this signature will continue to be correct
even if more code that returns other errors is added to the body of `main`.

When a `main` function returns a `Result<(), E>`, the executable will exit
with a value of `0` if `main` returns `Ok(())` and will exit with a nonzero
value if `main` returns an `Err` value. Executables written in C return
integers when they exit: Programs that exit successfully return the integer
`0`, and programs that error return some integer other than `0`. Rust also
returns integers from executables to be compatible with this convention.

The `main` function may return any types that implement [the
`std::process::Termination` trait](../std/process/trait.Termination.html),
which contains a function `report` that returns an `ExitCode`. Consult the
standard library documentation for more information on implementing the
`Termination` trait for your own types.

Now that we’ve discussed the details of calling `panic!` or returning
`Result`, let’s return to the topic of how to decide which is appropriate to
use in which cases.

# To panic! or Not to panic!

## To `panic!` or Not to `panic!`

So, how do you decide when you should call `panic!` and when you should return
`Result`? When code panics, there’s no way to recover. You could call `panic!`
for any error situation, whether there’s a possible way to recover or not, but
then you’re making the decision that a situation is unrecoverable on behalf of
the calling code. When you choose to return a `Result` value, you give the
calling code options. The calling code could choose to attempt to recover in a
way that’s appropriate for its situation, or it could decide that an `Err`
value in this case is unrecoverable, so it can call `panic!` and turn your
recoverable error into an unrecoverable one. Therefore, returning `Result` is
a good default choice when you’re defining a function that might fail.

In situations such as examples, prototype code, and tests, it’s more
appropriate to write code that panics instead of returning a `Result`. Let’s
explore why, then discuss situations in which the compiler can’t tell that
failure is impossible, but you as a human can. The chapter will conclude with
some general guidelines on how to decide whether to panic in library code.

### Examples, Prototype Code, and Tests

When you’re writing an example to illustrate some concept, also including
robust error-handling code can make the example less clear. In examples, it’s
understood that a call to a method like `unwrap` that could panic is meant as
a placeholder for the way you’d want your application to handle errors, which
can differ based on what the rest of your code is doing.

Similarly, the `unwrap` and `expect` methods are very handy when you’re
prototyping and you’re not yet ready to decide how to handle errors. They
leave clear markers in your code for when you’re ready to make your program
more robust.

If a method call fails in a test, you’d want the whole test to fail, even if
that method isn’t the functionality under test. Because `panic!` is how a test
is marked as a failure, calling `unwrap` or `expect` is exactly what should
happen.

### When You Have More Information Than the Compiler

It would also be appropriate to call `expect` when you have some other logic
that ensures that the `Result` will have an `Ok` value, but the logic isn’t
something the compiler understands. You’ll still have a `Result` value that
you need to handle: Whatever operation you’re calling still has the
possibility of failing in general, even though it’s logically impossible in
your particular situation. If you can ensure by manually inspecting the code
that you’ll never have an `Err` variant, it’s perfectly acceptable to call
`expect` and document the reason you think you’ll never have an `Err` variant
in the argument text. Here’s an example:

    
    
    fn main() {
        use std::net::IpAddr;
    
        let home: IpAddr = "127.0.0.1"
            .parse()
            .expect("Hardcoded IP address should be valid");
    }

We’re creating an `IpAddr` instance by parsing a hardcoded string. We can see
that `127.0.0.1` is a valid IP address, so it’s acceptable to use `expect`
here. However, having a hardcoded, valid string doesn’t change the return type
of the `parse` method: We still get a `Result` value, and the compiler will
still make us handle the `Result` as if the `Err` variant is a possibility
because the compiler isn’t smart enough to see that this string is always a
valid IP address. If the IP address string came from a user rather than being
hardcoded into the program and therefore _did_ have a possibility of failure,
we’d definitely want to handle the `Result` in a more robust way instead.
Mentioning the assumption that this IP address is hardcoded will prompt us to
change `expect` to better error-handling code if, in the future, we need to
get the IP address from some other source instead.

### Guidelines for Error Handling

It’s advisable to have your code panic when it’s possible that your code could
end up in a bad state. In this context, a _bad state_ is when some assumption,
guarantee, contract, or invariant has been broken, such as when invalid
values, contradictory values, or missing values are passed to your code—plus
one or more of the following:

  * The bad state is something that is unexpected, as opposed to something that will likely happen occasionally, like a user entering data in the wrong format.
  * Your code after this point needs to rely on not being in this bad state, rather than checking for the problem at every step.
  * There’s not a good way to encode this information in the types you use. We’ll work through an example of what we mean in “Encoding States and Behavior as Types” in Chapter 18.

If someone calls your code and passes in values that don’t make sense, it’s
best to return an error if you can so that the user of the library can decide
what they want to do in that case. However, in cases where continuing could be
insecure or harmful, the best choice might be to call `panic!` and alert the
person using your library to the bug in their code so that they can fix it
during development. Similarly, `panic!` is often appropriate if you’re calling
external code that is out of your control and returns an invalid state that
you have no way of fixing.

However, when failure is expected, it’s more appropriate to return a `Result`
than to make a `panic!` call. Examples include a parser being given malformed
data or an HTTP request returning a status that indicates you have hit a rate
limit. In these cases, returning a `Result` indicates that failure is an
expected possibility that the calling code must decide how to handle.

When your code performs an operation that could put a user at risk if it’s
called using invalid values, your code should verify the values are valid
first and panic if the values aren’t valid. This is mostly for safety reasons:
Attempting to operate on invalid data can expose your code to vulnerabilities.
This is the main reason the standard library will call `panic!` if you attempt
an out-of-bounds memory access: Trying to access memory that doesn’t belong to
the current data structure is a common security problem. Functions often have
_contracts_ : Their behavior is only guaranteed if the inputs meet particular
requirements. Panicking when the contract is violated makes sense because a
contract violation always indicates a caller-side bug, and it’s not a kind of
error you want the calling code to have to explicitly handle. In fact, there’s
no reasonable way for calling code to recover; the calling _programmers_ need
to fix the code. Contracts for a function, especially when a violation will
cause a panic, should be explained in the API documentation for the function.

However, having lots of error checks in all of your functions would be verbose
and annoying. Fortunately, you can use Rust’s type system (and thus the type
checking done by the compiler) to do many of the checks for you. If your
function has a particular type as a parameter, you can proceed with your
code’s logic knowing that the compiler has already ensured that you have a
valid value. For example, if you have a type rather than an `Option`, your
program expects to have _something_ rather than _nothing_. Your code then
doesn’t have to handle two cases for the `Some` and `None` variants: It will
only have one case for definitely having a value. Code trying to pass nothing
to your function won’t even compile, so your function doesn’t have to check
for that case at runtime. Another example is using an unsigned integer type
such as `u32`, which ensures that the parameter is never negative.

### Custom Types for Validation

Let’s take the idea of using Rust’s type system to ensure that we have a valid
value one step further and look at creating a custom type for validation.
Recall the guessing game in Chapter 2 in which our code asked the user to
guess a number between 1 and 100. We never validated that the user’s guess was
between those numbers before checking it against our secret number; we only
validated that the guess was positive. In this case, the consequences were not
very dire: Our output of “Too high” or “Too low” would still be correct. But
it would be a useful enhancement to guide the user toward valid guesses and
have different behavior when the user guesses a number that’s out of range
versus when the user types, for example, letters instead.

One way to do this would be to parse the guess as an `i32` instead of only a
`u32` to allow potentially negative numbers, and then add a check for the
number being in range, like so:

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    use rand::Rng;
    use std::cmp::Ordering;
    use std::io;
    
    fn main() {
        println!("Guess the number!");
    
        let secret_number = rand::thread_rng().gen_range(1..=100);
    
        loop {
            // --snip--
    
            println!("Please input your guess.");
    
            let mut guess = String::new();
    
            io::stdin()
                .read_line(&mut guess)
                .expect("Failed to read line");
    
            let guess: i32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
                Ok(num) => num,
                Err(_) => continue,
            };
    
            if guess < 1 || guess > 100 {
                println!("The secret number will be between 1 and 100.");
                continue;
            }
    
            match guess.cmp(&secret_number) {
                // --snip--
                Ordering::Less => println!("Too small!"),
                Ordering::Greater => println!("Too big!"),
                Ordering::Equal => {
                    println!("You win!");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

The `if` expression checks whether our value is out of range, tells the user
about the problem, and calls `continue` to start the next iteration of the
loop and ask for another guess. After the `if` expression, we can proceed with
the comparisons between `guess` and the secret number knowing that `guess` is
between 1 and 100.

However, this is not an ideal solution: If it were absolutely critical that
the program only operated on values between 1 and 100, and it had many
functions with this requirement, having a check like this in every function
would be tedious (and might impact performance).

Instead, we can make a new type in a dedicated module and put the validations
in a function to create an instance of the type rather than repeating the
validations everywhere. That way, it’s safe for functions to use the new type
in their signatures and confidently use the values they receive. Listing 9-13
shows one way to define a `Guess` type that will only create an instance of
`Guess` if the `new` function receives a value between 1 and 100.

Filename: src/guessing_game.rs

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    pub struct Guess {
        value: i32,
    }
    
    impl Guess {
        pub fn new(value: i32) -> Guess {
            if value < 1 || value > 100 {
                panic!("Guess value must be between 1 and 100, got {value}.");
            }
    
            Guess { value }
        }
    
        pub fn value(&self) -> i32 {
            self.value
        }
    }
    }

Listing 9-13: A `Guess` type that will only continue with values between 1 and
100

Note that this code in _src/guessing_game.rs_ depends on adding a module
declaration `mod guessing_game;` in _src/lib.rs_ that we haven’t shown here.
Within this new module’s file, we define a struct named `Guess` that has a
field named `value` that holds an `i32`. This is where the number will be
stored.

Then, we implement an associated function named `new` on `Guess` that creates
instances of `Guess` values. The `new` function is defined to have one
parameter named `value` of type `i32` and to return a `Guess`. The code in the
body of the `new` function tests `value` to make sure it’s between 1 and 100.
If `value` doesn’t pass this test, we make a `panic!` call, which will alert
the programmer who is writing the calling code that they have a bug they need
to fix, because creating a `Guess` with a `value` outside this range would
violate the contract that `Guess::new` is relying on. The conditions in which
`Guess::new` might panic should be discussed in its public-facing API
documentation; we’ll cover documentation conventions indicating the
possibility of a `panic!` in the API documentation that you create in Chapter
14. If `value` does pass the test, we create a new `Guess` with its `value`
field set to the `value` parameter and return the `Guess`.

Next, we implement a method named `value` that borrows `self`, doesn’t have
any other parameters, and returns an `i32`. This kind of method is sometimes
called a _getter_ because its purpose is to get some data from its fields and
return it. This public method is necessary because the `value` field of the
`Guess` struct is private. It’s important that the `value` field be private so
that code using the `Guess` struct is not allowed to set `value` directly:
Code outside the `guessing_game` module _must_ use the `Guess::new` function
to create an instance of `Guess`, thereby ensuring that there’s no way for a
`Guess` to have a `value` that hasn’t been checked by the conditions in the
`Guess::new` function.

A function that has a parameter or returns only numbers between 1 and 100
could then declare in its signature that it takes or returns a `Guess` rather
than an `i32` and wouldn’t need to do any additional checks in its body.

## Summary

Rust’s error-handling features are designed to help you write more robust
code. The `panic!` macro signals that your program is in a state it can’t
handle and lets you tell the process to stop instead of trying to proceed with
invalid or incorrect values. The `Result` enum uses Rust’s type system to
indicate that operations might fail in a way that your code could recover
from. You can use `Result` to tell code that calls your code that it needs to
handle potential success or failure as well. Using `panic!` and `Result` in
the appropriate situations will make your code more reliable in the face of
inevitable problems.

Now that you’ve seen useful ways that the standard library uses generics with
the `Option` and `Result` enums, we’ll talk about how generics work and how
you can use them in your code.

# Generic Types, Traits, and Lifetimes

Every programming language has tools for effectively handling the duplication
of concepts. In Rust, one such tool is _generics_ : abstract stand-ins for
concrete types or other properties. We can express the behavior of generics or
how they relate to other generics without knowing what will be in their place
when compiling and running the code.

Functions can take parameters of some generic type, instead of a concrete type
like `i32` or `String`, in the same way they take parameters with unknown
values to run the same code on multiple concrete values. In fact, we already
used generics in Chapter 6 with `Option<T>`, in Chapter 8 with `Vec<T>` and
`HashMap<K, V>`, and in Chapter 9 with `Result<T, E>`. In this chapter, you’ll
explore how to define your own types, functions, and methods with generics!

First, we’ll review how to extract a function to reduce code duplication.
We’ll then use the same technique to make a generic function from two
functions that differ only in the types of their parameters. We’ll also
explain how to use generic types in struct and enum definitions.

Then, you’ll learn how to use traits to define behavior in a generic way. You
can combine traits with generic types to constrain a generic type to accept
only those types that have a particular behavior, as opposed to just any type.

Finally, we’ll discuss _lifetimes_ : a variety of generics that give the
compiler information about how references relate to each other. Lifetimes
allow us to give the compiler enough information about borrowed values so that
it can ensure that references will be valid in more situations than it could
without our help.

## Removing Duplication by Extracting a Function

Generics allow us to replace specific types with a placeholder that represents
multiple types to remove code duplication. Before diving into generics syntax,
let’s first look at how to remove duplication in a way that doesn’t involve
generic types by extracting a function that replaces specific values with a
placeholder that represents multiple values. Then, we’ll apply the same
technique to extract a generic function! By looking at how to recognize
duplicated code you can extract into a function, you’ll start to recognize
duplicated code that can use generics.

We’ll begin with the short program in Listing 10-1 that finds the largest
number in a list.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    
        let mut largest = &number_list[0];
    
        for number in &number_list {
            if number > largest {
                largest = number;
            }
        }
    
        println!("The largest number is {largest}");
        assert_eq!(*largest, 100);
    }

Listing 10-1: Finding the largest number in a list of numbers

We store a list of integers in the variable `number_list` and place a
reference to the first number in the list in a variable named `largest`. We
then iterate through all the numbers in the list, and if the current number is
greater than the number stored in `largest`, we replace the reference in that
variable. However, if the current number is less than or equal to the largest
number seen so far, the variable doesn’t change, and the code moves on to the
next number in the list. After considering all the numbers in the list,
`largest` should refer to the largest number, which in this case is 100.

We’ve now been tasked with finding the largest number in two different lists
of numbers. To do so, we can choose to duplicate the code in Listing 10-1 and
use the same logic at two different places in the program, as shown in Listing
10-2.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    
        let mut largest = &number_list[0];
    
        for number in &number_list {
            if number > largest {
                largest = number;
            }
        }
    
        println!("The largest number is {largest}");
    
        let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];
    
        let mut largest = &number_list[0];
    
        for number in &number_list {
            if number > largest {
                largest = number;
            }
        }
    
        println!("The largest number is {largest}");
    }

Listing 10-2: Code to find the largest number in _two_ lists of numbers

Although this code works, duplicating code is tedious and error-prone. We also
have to remember to update the code in multiple places when we want to change
it.

To eliminate this duplication, we’ll create an abstraction by defining a
function that operates on any list of integers passed in as a parameter. This
solution makes our code clearer and lets us express the concept of finding the
largest number in a list abstractly.

In Listing 10-3, we extract the code that finds the largest number into a
function named `largest`. Then, we call the function to find the largest
number in the two lists from Listing 10-2. We could also use the function on
any other list of `i32` values we might have in the future.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn largest(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
        let mut largest = &list[0];
    
        for item in list {
            if item > largest {
                largest = item;
            }
        }
    
        largest
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    
        let result = largest(&number_list);
        println!("The largest number is {result}");
        assert_eq!(*result, 100);
    
        let number_list = vec![102, 34, 6000, 89, 54, 2, 43, 8];
    
        let result = largest(&number_list);
        println!("The largest number is {result}");
        assert_eq!(*result, 6000);
    }

Listing 10-3: Abstracted code to find the largest number in two lists

The `largest` function has a parameter called `list`, which represents any
concrete slice of `i32` values we might pass into the function. As a result,
when we call the function, the code runs on the specific values that we pass
in.

In summary, here are the steps we took to change the code from Listing 10-2 to
Listing 10-3:

  1. Identify duplicate code.
  2. Extract the duplicate code into the body of the function, and specify the inputs and return values of that code in the function signature.
  3. Update the two instances of duplicated code to call the function instead.

Next, we’ll use these same steps with generics to reduce code duplication. In
the same way that the function body can operate on an abstract `list` instead
of specific values, generics allow code to operate on abstract types.

For example, say we had two functions: one that finds the largest item in a
slice of `i32` values and one that finds the largest item in a slice of `char`
values. How would we eliminate that duplication? Let’s find out!

# Generic Data Types

## Generic Data Types

We use generics to create definitions for items like function signatures or
structs, which we can then use with many different concrete data types. Let’s
first look at how to define functions, structs, enums, and methods using
generics. Then, we’ll discuss how generics affect code performance.

### In Function Definitions

When defining a function that uses generics, we place the generics in the
signature of the function where we would usually specify the data types of the
parameters and return value. Doing so makes our code more flexible and
provides more functionality to callers of our function while preventing code
duplication.

Continuing with our `largest` function, Listing 10-4 shows two functions that
both find the largest value in a slice. We’ll then combine these into a single
function that uses generics.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn largest_i32(list: &[i32]) -> &i32 {
        let mut largest = &list[0];
    
        for item in list {
            if item > largest {
                largest = item;
            }
        }
    
        largest
    }
    
    fn largest_char(list: &[char]) -> &char {
        let mut largest = &list[0];
    
        for item in list {
            if item > largest {
                largest = item;
            }
        }
    
        largest
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    
        let result = largest_i32(&number_list);
        println!("The largest number is {result}");
        assert_eq!(*result, 100);
    
        let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    
        let result = largest_char(&char_list);
        println!("The largest char is {result}");
        assert_eq!(*result, 'y');
    }

Listing 10-4: Two functions that differ only in their names and in the types
in their signatures

The `largest_i32` function is the one we extracted in Listing 10-3 that finds
the largest `i32` in a slice. The `largest_char` function finds the largest
`char` in a slice. The function bodies have the same code, so let’s eliminate
the duplication by introducing a generic type parameter in a single function.

To parameterize the types in a new single function, we need to name the type
parameter, just as we do for the value parameters to a function. You can use
any identifier as a type parameter name. But we’ll use `T` because, by
convention, type parameter names in Rust are short, often just one letter, and
Rust’s type-naming convention is UpperCamelCase. Short for _type_ , `T` is the
default choice of most Rust programmers.

When we use a parameter in the body of the function, we have to declare the
parameter name in the signature so that the compiler knows what that name
means. Similarly, when we use a type parameter name in a function signature,
we have to declare the type parameter name before we use it. To define the
generic `largest` function, we place type name declarations inside angle
brackets, `<>`, between the name of the function and the parameter list, like
this:

    
    
    fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {

We read this definition as “The function `largest` is generic over some type
`T`.” This function has one parameter named `list`, which is a slice of values
of type `T`. The `largest` function will return a reference to a value of the
same type `T`.

Listing 10-5 shows the combined `largest` function definition using the
generic data type in its signature. The listing also shows how we can call the
function with either a slice of `i32` values or `char` values. Note that this
code won’t compile yet.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
        let mut largest = &list[0];
    
        for item in list {
            if item > largest {
                largest = item;
            }
        }
    
        largest
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];
    
        let result = largest(&number_list);
        println!("The largest number is {result}");
    
        let char_list = vec!['y', 'm', 'a', 'q'];
    
        let result = largest(&char_list);
        println!("The largest char is {result}");
    }

Listing 10-5: The `largest` function using generic type parameters; this
doesn’t compile yet

If we compile this code right now, we’ll get this error:

    
    
    $ cargo run

The help text mentions `std::cmp::PartialOrd`, which is a trait, and we’re
going to talk about traits in the next section. For now, know that this error
states that the body of `largest` won’t work for all possible types that `T`
could be. Because we want to compare values of type `T` in the body, we can
only use types whose values can be ordered. To enable comparisons, the
standard library has the `std::cmp::PartialOrd` trait that you can implement
on types (see Appendix C for more on this trait). To fix Listing 10-5, we can
follow the help text’s suggestion and restrict the types valid for `T` to only
those that implement `PartialOrd`. The listing will then compile, because the
standard library implements `PartialOrd` on both `i32` and `char`.

### In Struct Definitions

We can also define structs to use a generic type parameter in one or more
fields using the `<>` syntax. Listing 10-6 defines a `Point<T>` struct to hold
`x` and `y` coordinate values of any type.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Point<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
        let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    }

Listing 10-6: A `Point<T>` struct that holds `x` and `y` values of type `T`

The syntax for using generics in struct definitions is similar to that used in
function definitions. First, we declare the name of the type parameter inside
angle brackets just after the name of the struct. Then, we use the generic
type in the struct definition where we would otherwise specify concrete data
types.

Note that because we’ve used only one generic type to define `Point<T>`, this
definition says that the `Point<T>` struct is generic over some type `T`, and
the fields `x` and `y` are _both_ that same type, whatever that type may be.
If we create an instance of a `Point<T>` that has values of different types,
as in Listing 10-7, our code won’t compile.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Point<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
    }

Listing 10-7: The fields `x` and `y` must be the same type because both have
the same generic data type `T`.

In this example, when we assign the integer value `5` to `x`, we let the
compiler know that the generic type `T` will be an integer for this instance
of `Point<T>`. Then, when we specify `4.0` for `y`, which we’ve defined to
have the same type as `x`, we’ll get a type mismatch error like this:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
    error[E0308]: mismatched types
     --> src/main.rs:7:38
      |
    7 |     let wont_work = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
      |                                      ^^^ expected integer, found floating-point number
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0308`.
    error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error
    

To define a `Point` struct where `x` and `y` are both generics but could have
different types, we can use multiple generic type parameters. For example, in
Listing 10-8, we change the definition of `Point` to be generic over types `T`
and `U` where `x` is of type `T` and `y` is of type `U`.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Point<T, U> {
        x: T,
        y: U,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
        let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
        let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
    }

Listing 10-8: A `Point<T, U>` generic over two types so that `x` and `y` can
be values of different types

Now all the instances of `Point` shown are allowed! You can use as many
generic type parameters in a definition as you want, but using more than a few
makes your code hard to read. If you’re finding you need lots of generic types
in your code, it could indicate that your code needs restructuring into
smaller pieces.

### In Enum Definitions

As we did with structs, we can define enums to hold generic data types in
their variants. Let’s take another look at the `Option<T>` enum that the
standard library provides, which we used in Chapter 6:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    enum Option<T> {
        Some(T),
        None,
    }
    }

This definition should now make more sense to you. As you can see, the
`Option<T>` enum is generic over type `T` and has two variants: `Some`, which
holds one value of type `T`, and a `None` variant that doesn’t hold any value.
By using the `Option<T>` enum, we can express the abstract concept of an
optional value, and because `Option<T>` is generic, we can use this
abstraction no matter what the type of the optional value is.

Enums can use multiple generic types as well. The definition of the `Result`
enum that we used in Chapter 9 is one example:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    enum Result<T, E> {
        Ok(T),
        Err(E),
    }
    }

The `Result` enum is generic over two types, `T` and `E`, and has two
variants: `Ok`, which holds a value of type `T`, and `Err`, which holds a
value of type `E`. This definition makes it convenient to use the `Result`
enum anywhere we have an operation that might succeed (return a value of some
type `T`) or fail (return an error of some type `E`). In fact, this is what we
used to open a file in Listing 9-3, where `T` was filled in with the type
`std::fs::File` when the file was opened successfully and `E` was filled in
with the type `std::io::Error` when there were problems opening the file.

When you recognize situations in your code with multiple struct or enum
definitions that differ only in the types of the values they hold, you can
avoid duplication by using generic types instead.

### In Method Definitions

We can implement methods on structs and enums (as we did in Chapter 5) and use
generic types in their definitions too. Listing 10-9 shows the `Point<T>`
struct we defined in Listing 10-6 with a method named `x` implemented on it.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Point<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }
    
    impl<T> Point<T> {
        fn x(&self) -> &T {
            &self.x
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    
        println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
    }

Listing 10-9: Implementing a method named `x` on the `Point<T>` struct that
will return a reference to the `x` field of type `T`

Here, we’ve defined a method named `x` on `Point<T>` that returns a reference
to the data in the field `x`.

Note that we have to declare `T` just after `impl` so that we can use `T` to
specify that we’re implementing methods on the type `Point<T>`. By declaring
`T` as a generic type after `impl`, Rust can identify that the type in the
angle brackets in `Point` is a generic type rather than a concrete type. We
could have chosen a different name for this generic parameter than the generic
parameter declared in the struct definition, but using the same name is
conventional. If you write a method within an `impl` that declares a generic
type, that method will be defined on any instance of the type, no matter what
concrete type ends up substituting for the generic type.

We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the
type. We could, for example, implement methods only on `Point<f32>` instances
rather than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type. In Listing 10-10,
we use the concrete type `f32`, meaning we don’t declare any types after
`impl`.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Point<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }
    
    impl<T> Point<T> {
        fn x(&self) -> &T {
            &self.x
        }
    }
    
    impl Point<f32> {
        fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
            (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    
        println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
    }

Listing 10-10: An `impl` block that only applies to a struct with a particular
concrete type for the generic type parameter `T`

This code means the type `Point<f32>` will have a `distance_from_origin`
method; other instances of `Point<T>` where `T` is not of type `f32` will not
have this method defined. The method measures how far our point is from the
point at coordinates (0.0, 0.0) and uses mathematical operations that are
available only for floating-point types.

Generic type parameters in a struct definition aren’t always the same as those
you use in that same struct’s method signatures. Listing 10-11 uses the
generic types `X1` and `Y1` for the `Point` struct and `X2` and `Y2` for the
`mixup` method signature to make the example clearer. The method creates a new
`Point` instance with the `x` value from the `self` `Point` (of type `X1`) and
the `y` value from the passed-in `Point` (of type `Y2`).

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    struct Point<X1, Y1> {
        x: X1,
        y: Y1,
    }
    
    impl<X1, Y1> Point<X1, Y1> {
        fn mixup<X2, Y2>(self, other: Point<X2, Y2>) -> Point<X1, Y2> {
            Point {
                x: self.x,
                y: other.y,
            }
        }
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let p1 = Point { x: 5, y: 10.4 };
        let p2 = Point { x: "Hello", y: 'c' };
    
        let p3 = p1.mixup(p2);
    
        println!("p3.x = {}, p3.y = {}", p3.x, p3.y);
    }

Listing 10-11: A method that uses generic types that are different from its
struct’s definition

In `main`, we’ve defined a `Point` that has an `i32` for `x` (with value `5`)
and an `f64` for `y` (with value `10.4`). The `p2` variable is a `Point`
struct that has a string slice for `x` (with value `"Hello"`) and a `char` for
`y` (with value `c`). Calling `mixup` on `p1` with the argument `p2` gives us
`p3`, which will have an `i32` for `x` because `x` came from `p1`. The `p3`
variable will have a `char` for `y` because `y` came from `p2`. The `println!`
macro call will print `p3.x = 5, p3.y = c`.

The purpose of this example is to demonstrate a situation in which some
generic parameters are declared with `impl` and some are declared with the
method definition. Here, the generic parameters `X1` and `Y1` are declared
after `impl` because they go with the struct definition. The generic
parameters `X2` and `Y2` are declared after `fn mixup` because they’re only
relevant to the method.

### Performance of Code Using Generics

You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using generic type
parameters. The good news is that using generic types won’t make your program
run any slower than it would with concrete types.

Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using
generics at compile time. _Monomorphization_ is the process of turning generic
code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when
compiled. In this process, the compiler does the opposite of the steps we used
to create the generic function in Listing 10-5: The compiler looks at all the
places where generic code is called and generates code for the concrete types
the generic code is called with.

Let’s look at how this works by using the standard library’s generic
`Option<T>` enum:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let integer = Some(5);
    let float = Some(5.0);
    }

When Rust compiles this code, it performs monomorphization. During that
process, the compiler reads the values that have been used in `Option<T>`
instances and identifies two kinds of `Option<T>`: One is `i32` and the other
is `f64`. As such, it expands the generic definition of `Option<T>` into two
definitions specialized to `i32` and `f64`, thereby replacing the generic
definition with the specific ones.

The monomorphized version of the code looks similar to the following (the
compiler uses different names than what we’re using here for illustration):

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    enum Option_i32 {
        Some(i32),
        None,
    }
    
    enum Option_f64 {
        Some(f64),
        None,
    }
    
    fn main() {
        let integer = Option_i32::Some(5);
        let float = Option_f64::Some(5.0);
    }

The generic `Option<T>` is replaced with the specific definitions created by
the compiler. Because Rust compiles generic code into code that specifies the
type in each instance, we pay no runtime cost for using generics. When the
code runs, it performs just as it would if we had duplicated each definition
by hand. The process of monomorphization makes Rust’s generics extremely
efficient at runtime.

# Defining Shared Behavior with Traits

## Defining Shared Behavior with Traits

A _trait_ defines the functionality a particular type has and can share with
other types. We can use traits to define shared behavior in an abstract way.
We can use _trait bounds_ to specify that a generic type can be any type that
has certain behavior.

Note: Traits are similar to a feature often called _interfaces_ in other
languages, although with some differences.

### Defining a Trait

A type’s behavior consists of the methods we can call on that type. Different
types share the same behavior if we can call the same methods on all of those
types. Trait definitions are a way to group method signatures together to
define a set of behaviors necessary to accomplish some purpose.

For example, let’s say we have multiple structs that hold various kinds and
amounts of text: a `NewsArticle` struct that holds a news story filed in a
particular location and a `SocialPost` that can have, at most, 280 characters
along with metadata that indicates whether it was a new post, a repost, or a
reply to another post.

We want to make a media aggregator library crate named `aggregator` that can
display summaries of data that might be stored in a `NewsArticle` or
`SocialPost` instance. To do this, we need a summary from each type, and we’ll
request that summary by calling a `summarize` method on an instance. Listing
10-12 shows the definition of a public `Summary` trait that expresses this
behavior.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    }

Listing 10-12: A `Summary` trait that consists of the behavior provided by a
`summarize` method

Here, we declare a trait using the `trait` keyword and then the trait’s name,
which is `Summary` in this case. We also declare the trait as `pub` so that
crates depending on this crate can make use of this trait too, as we’ll see in
a few examples. Inside the curly brackets, we declare the method signatures
that describe the behaviors of the types that implement this trait, which in
this case is `fn summarize(&self) -> String`.

After the method signature, instead of providing an implementation within
curly brackets, we use a semicolon. Each type implementing this trait must
provide its own custom behavior for the body of the method. The compiler will
enforce that any type that has the `Summary` trait will have the method
`summarize` defined with this signature exactly.

A trait can have multiple methods in its body: The method signatures are
listed one per line, and each line ends in a semicolon.

### Implementing a Trait on a Type

Now that we’ve defined the desired signatures of the `Summary` trait’s
methods, we can implement it on the types in our media aggregator. Listing
10-13 shows an implementation of the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle`
struct that uses the headline, the author, and the location to create the
return value of `summarize`. For the `SocialPost` struct, we define
`summarize` as the username followed by the entire text of the post, assuming
that the post content is already limited to 280 characters.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    }
    
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }
    
    impl Summary for NewsArticle {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
        }
    }
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }

Listing 10-13: Implementing the `Summary` trait on the `NewsArticle` and
`SocialPost` types

Implementing a trait on a type is similar to implementing regular methods. The
difference is that after `impl`, we put the trait name we want to implement,
then use the `for` keyword, and then specify the name of the type we want to
implement the trait for. Within the `impl` block, we put the method signatures
that the trait definition has defined. Instead of adding a semicolon after
each signature, we use curly brackets and fill in the method body with the
specific behavior that we want the methods of the trait to have for the
particular type.

Now that the library has implemented the `Summary` trait on `NewsArticle` and
`SocialPost`, users of the crate can call the trait methods on instances of
`NewsArticle` and `SocialPost` in the same way we call regular methods. The
only difference is that the user must bring the trait into scope as well as
the types. Here’s an example of how a binary crate could use our `aggregator`
library crate:

    
    
    use aggregator::{SocialPost, Summary};
    
    fn main() {
        let post = SocialPost {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            repost: false,
        };
    
        println!("1 new post: {}", post.summarize());
    }

This code prints `1 new post: horse_ebooks: of course, as you probably already
know, people`.

Other crates that depend on the `aggregator` crate can also bring the
`Summary` trait into scope to implement `Summary` on their own types. One
restriction to note is that we can implement a trait on a type only if either
the trait or the type, or both, are local to our crate. For example, we can
implement standard library traits like `Display` on a custom type like
`SocialPost` as part of our `aggregator` crate functionality because the type
`SocialPost` is local to our `aggregator` crate. We can also implement
`Summary` on `Vec<T>` in our `aggregator` crate because the trait `Summary` is
local to our `aggregator` crate.

But we can’t implement external traits on external types. For example, we
can’t implement the `Display` trait on `Vec<T>` within our `aggregator` crate,
because `Display` and `Vec<T>` are both defined in the standard library and
aren’t local to our `aggregator` crate. This restriction is part of a property
called _coherence_ , and more specifically the _orphan rule_ , so named
because the parent type is not present. This rule ensures that other people’s
code can’t break your code and vice versa. Without the rule, two crates could
implement the same trait for the same type, and Rust wouldn’t know which
implementation to use.

### Using Default Implementations

Sometimes it’s useful to have default behavior for some or all of the methods
in a trait instead of requiring implementations for all methods on every type.
Then, as we implement the trait on a particular type, we can keep or override
each method’s default behavior.

In Listing 10-14, we specify a default string for the `summarize` method of
the `Summary` trait instead of only defining the method signature, as we did
in Listing 10-12.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            String::from("(Read more...)")
        }
    }
    
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }
    
    impl Summary for NewsArticle {}
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }

Listing 10-14: Defining a `Summary` trait with a default implementation of the
`summarize` method

To use a default implementation to summarize instances of `NewsArticle`, we
specify an empty `impl` block with `impl Summary for NewsArticle {}`.

Even though we’re no longer defining the `summarize` method on `NewsArticle`
directly, we’ve provided a default implementation and specified that
`NewsArticle` implements the `Summary` trait. As a result, we can still call
the `summarize` method on an instance of `NewsArticle`, like this:

    
    
    use aggregator::{self, NewsArticle, Summary};
    
    fn main() {
        let article = NewsArticle {
            headline: String::from("Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!"),
            location: String::from("Pittsburgh, PA, USA"),
            author: String::from("Iceburgh"),
            content: String::from(
                "The Pittsburgh Penguins once again are the best \
                 hockey team in the NHL.",
            ),
        };
    
        println!("New article available! {}", article.summarize());
    }

This code prints `New article available! (Read more...)`.

Creating a default implementation doesn’t require us to change anything about
the implementation of `Summary` on `SocialPost` in Listing 10-13. The reason
is that the syntax for overriding a default implementation is the same as the
syntax for implementing a trait method that doesn’t have a default
implementation.

Default implementations can call other methods in the same trait, even if
those other methods don’t have a default implementation. In this way, a trait
can provide a lot of useful functionality and only require implementors to
specify a small part of it. For example, we could define the `Summary` trait
to have a `summarize_author` method whose implementation is required, and then
define a `summarize` method that has a default implementation that calls the
`summarize_author` method:

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;
    
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
        }
    }
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
            format!("@{}", self.username)
        }
    }

To use this version of `Summary`, we only need to define `summarize_author`
when we implement the trait on a type:

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String;
    
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("(Read more from {}...)", self.summarize_author())
        }
    }
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize_author(&self) -> String {
            format!("@{}", self.username)
        }
    }

After we define `summarize_author`, we can call `summarize` on instances of
the `SocialPost` struct, and the default implementation of `summarize` will
call the definition of `summarize_author` that we’ve provided. Because we’ve
implemented `summarize_author`, the `Summary` trait has given us the behavior
of the `summarize` method without requiring us to write any more code. Here’s
what that looks like:

    
    
    use aggregator::{self, SocialPost, Summary};
    
    fn main() {
        let post = SocialPost {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            repost: false,
        };
    
        println!("1 new post: {}", post.summarize());
    }

This code prints `1 new post: (Read more from @horse_ebooks...)`.

Note that it isn’t possible to call the default implementation from an
overriding implementation of that same method.

### Using Traits as Parameters

Now that you know how to define and implement traits, we can explore how to
use traits to define functions that accept many different types. We’ll use the
`Summary` trait we implemented on the `NewsArticle` and `SocialPost` types in
Listing 10-13 to define a `notify` function that calls the `summarize` method
on its `item` parameter, which is of some type that implements the `Summary`
trait. To do this, we use the `impl Trait` syntax, like this:

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    }
    
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }
    
    impl Summary for NewsArticle {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
        }
    }
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }
    
    pub fn notify(item: &impl Summary) {
        println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
    }

Instead of a concrete type for the `item` parameter, we specify the `impl`
keyword and the trait name. This parameter accepts any type that implements
the specified trait. In the body of `notify`, we can call any methods on
`item` that come from the `Summary` trait, such as `summarize`. We can call
`notify` and pass in any instance of `NewsArticle` or `SocialPost`. Code that
calls the function with any other type, such as a `String` or an `i32`, won’t
compile, because those types don’t implement `Summary`.

#### Trait Bound Syntax

The `impl Trait` syntax works for straightforward cases but is actually syntax
sugar for a longer form known as a _trait bound_ ; it looks like this:

    
    
    pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item: &T) {
        println!("Breaking news! {}", item.summarize());
    }

This longer form is equivalent to the example in the previous section but is
more verbose. We place trait bounds with the declaration of the generic type
parameter after a colon and inside angle brackets.

The `impl Trait` syntax is convenient and makes for more concise code in
simple cases, while the fuller trait bound syntax can express more complexity
in other cases. For example, we can have two parameters that implement
`Summary`. Doing so with the `impl Trait` syntax looks like this:

    
    
    pub fn notify(item1: &impl Summary, item2: &impl Summary) {

Using `impl Trait` is appropriate if we want this function to allow `item1`
and `item2` to have different types (as long as both types implement
`Summary`). If we want to force both parameters to have the same type,
however, we must use a trait bound, like this:

    
    
    pub fn notify<T: Summary>(item1: &T, item2: &T) {

The generic type `T` specified as the type of the `item1` and `item2`
parameters constrains the function such that the concrete type of the value
passed as an argument for `item1` and `item2` must be the same.

#### Multiple Trait Bounds with the `+` Syntax

We can also specify more than one trait bound. Say we wanted `notify` to use
display formatting as well as `summarize` on `item`: We specify in the
`notify` definition that `item` must implement both `Display` and `Summary`.
We can do so using the `+` syntax:

    
    
    pub fn notify(item: &(impl Summary + Display)) {

The `+` syntax is also valid with trait bounds on generic types:

    
    
    pub fn notify<T: Summary + Display>(item: &T) {

With the two trait bounds specified, the body of `notify` can call `summarize`
and use `{}` to format `item`.

#### Clearer Trait Bounds with `where` Clauses

Using too many trait bounds has its downsides. Each generic has its own trait
bounds, so functions with multiple generic type parameters can contain lots of
trait bound information between the function’s name and its parameter list,
making the function signature hard to read. For this reason, Rust has
alternate syntax for specifying trait bounds inside a `where` clause after the
function signature. So, instead of writing this:

    
    
    fn some_function<T: Display + Clone, U: Clone + Debug>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32 {

we can use a `where` clause, like this:

    
    
    fn some_function<T, U>(t: &T, u: &U) -> i32
    where
        T: Display + Clone,
        U: Clone + Debug,
    {
        unimplemented!()
    }

This function’s signature is less cluttered: The function name, parameter
list, and return type are close together, similar to a function without lots
of trait bounds.

### Returning Types That Implement Traits

We can also use the `impl Trait` syntax in the return position to return a
value of some type that implements a trait, as shown here:

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    }
    
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }
    
    impl Summary for NewsArticle {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
        }
    }
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }
    
    fn returns_summarizable() -> impl Summary {
        SocialPost {
            username: String::from("horse_ebooks"),
            content: String::from(
                "of course, as you probably already know, people",
            ),
            reply: false,
            repost: false,
        }
    }

By using `impl Summary` for the return type, we specify that the
`returns_summarizable` function returns some type that implements the
`Summary` trait without naming the concrete type. In this case,
`returns_summarizable` returns a `SocialPost`, but the code calling this
function doesn’t need to know that.

The ability to specify a return type only by the trait it implements is
especially useful in the context of closures and iterators, which we cover in
Chapter 13. Closures and iterators create types that only the compiler knows
or types that are very long to specify. The `impl Trait` syntax lets you
concisely specify that a function returns some type that implements the
`Iterator` trait without needing to write out a very long type.

However, you can only use `impl Trait` if you’re returning a single type. For
example, this code that returns either a `NewsArticle` or a `SocialPost` with
the return type specified as `impl Summary` wouldn’t work:

    
    
    pub trait Summary {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String;
    }
    
    pub struct NewsArticle {
        pub headline: String,
        pub location: String,
        pub author: String,
        pub content: String,
    }
    
    impl Summary for NewsArticle {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}, by {} ({})", self.headline, self.author, self.location)
        }
    }
    
    pub struct SocialPost {
        pub username: String,
        pub content: String,
        pub reply: bool,
        pub repost: bool,
    }
    
    impl Summary for SocialPost {
        fn summarize(&self) -> String {
            format!("{}: {}", self.username, self.content)
        }
    }
    
    fn returns_summarizable(switch: bool) -> impl Summary {
        if switch {
            NewsArticle {
                headline: String::from(
                    "Penguins win the Stanley Cup Championship!",
                ),

                     hockey team in the NHL.",
                ),

                repost: false,
            }
        }
    }

Returning either a `NewsArticle` or a `SocialPost` isn’t allowed due to
restrictions around how the `impl Trait` syntax is implemented in the
compiler. We’ll cover how to write a function with this behavior in the “Using
Trait Objects to Abstract over Shared Behavior” section of Chapter 18.

### Using Trait Bounds to Conditionally Implement Methods

By using a trait bound with an `impl` block that uses generic type parameters,
we can implement methods conditionally for types that implement the specified
traits. For example, the type `Pair<T>` in Listing 10-15 always implements the
`new` function to return a new instance of `Pair<T>` (recall from the “Method
Syntax” section of Chapter 5 that `Self` is a type alias for the type of the
`impl` block, which in this case is `Pair<T>`). But in the next `impl` block,
`Pair<T>` only implements the `cmp_display` method if its inner type `T`
implements the `PartialOrd` trait that enables comparison _and_ the `Display`
trait that enables printing.

Filename: src/lib.rs

    
    
    use std::fmt::Display;
    
    struct Pair<T> {
        x: T,
        y: T,
    }
    
    impl<T> Pair<T> {
        fn new(x: T, y: T) -> Self {
            Self { x, y }
        }
    }
    
    impl<T: Display + PartialOrd> Pair<T> {
        fn cmp_display(&self) {
            if self.x >= self.y {
                println!("The largest member is x = {}", self.x);
            } else {
                println!("The largest member is y = {}", self.y);
            }
        }
    }

Listing 10-15: Conditionally implementing methods on a generic type depending
on trait bounds

We can also conditionally implement a trait for any type that implements
another trait. Implementations of a trait on any type that satisfies the trait
bounds are called _blanket implementations_ and are used extensively in the
Rust standard library. For example, the standard library implements the
`ToString` trait on any type that implements the `Display` trait. The `impl`
block in the standard library looks similar to this code:

    
    
    impl<T: Display> ToString for T {
        // --snip--
    }

Because the standard library has this blanket implementation, we can call the
`to_string` method defined by the `ToString` trait on any type that implements
the `Display` trait. For example, we can turn integers into their
corresponding `String` values like this because integers implement `Display`:

    
    
    #![allow(unused)]
    fn main() {
    let s = 3.to_string();
    }

Blanket implementations appear in the documentation for the trait in the
“Implementors” section.

Traits and trait bounds let us write code that uses generic type parameters to
reduce duplication but also specify to the compiler that we want the generic
type to have particular behavior. The compiler can then use the trait bound
information to check that all the concrete types used with our code provide
the correct behavior. In dynamically typed languages, we would get an error at
runtime if we called a method on a type that didn’t define the method. But
Rust moves these errors to compile time so that we’re forced to fix the
problems before our code is even able to run. Additionally, we don’t have to
write code that checks for behavior at runtime, because we’ve already checked
at compile time. Doing so improves performance without having to give up the
flexibility of generics.

# Validating References with Lifetimes

## Validating References with Lifetimes

Lifetimes are another kind of generic that we’ve already been using. Rather
than ensuring that a type has the behavior we want, lifetimes ensure that
references are valid as long as we need them to be.

One detail we didn’t discuss in the “References and Borrowing” section in
Chapter 4 is that every reference in Rust has a lifetime, which is the scope
for which that reference is valid. Most of the time, lifetimes are implicit
and inferred, just like most of the time, types are inferred. We are only
required to annotate types when multiple types are possible. In a similar way,
we must annotate lifetimes when the lifetimes of references could be related
in a few different ways. Rust requires us to annotate the relationships using
generic lifetime parameters to ensure that the actual references used at
runtime will definitely be valid.

Annotating lifetimes is not even a concept most other programming languages
have, so this is going to feel unfamiliar. Although we won’t cover lifetimes
in their entirety in this chapter, we’ll discuss common ways you might
encounter lifetime syntax so that you can get comfortable with the concept.

### Dangling References

The main aim of lifetimes is to prevent dangling references, which, if they
were allowed to exist, would cause a program to reference data other than the
data it’s intended to reference. Consider the program in Listing 10-16, which
has an outer scope and an inner scope.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let r;
    
        {
            let x = 5;
            r = &x;
        }
    
        println!("r: {r}");
    }

Listing 10-16: An attempt to use a reference whose value has gone out of scope

Note: The examples in Listings 10-16, 10-17, and 10-23 declare variables
without giving them an initial value, so the variable name exists in the outer
scope. At first glance, this might appear to be in conflict with Rust having
no null values. However, if we try to use a variable before giving it a value,
we’ll get a compile-time error, which shows that indeed Rust does not allow
null values.

The outer scope declares a variable named `r` with no initial value, and the
inner scope declares a variable named `x` with the initial value of `5`.
Inside the inner scope, we attempt to set the value of `r` as a reference to
`x`. Then, the inner scope ends, and we attempt to print the value in `r`.
This code won’t compile, because the value that `r` is referring to has gone
out of scope before we try to use it. Here is the error message:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
    error[E0597]: `x` does not live long enough

    5 |         let x = 5;
      |             - binding `x` declared here
    6 |         r = &x;
      |             ^^ borrowed value does not live long enough
    7 |     }
      |     - `x` dropped here while still borrowed
    8 |
    9 |     println!("r: {r}");
      |                   - borrow later used here
    
    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0597`.
    error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error
    

The error message says that the variable `x` “does not live long enough.” The
reason is that `x` will be out of scope when the inner scope ends on line 7.
But `r` is still valid for the outer scope; because its scope is larger, we
say that it “lives longer.” If Rust allowed this code to work, `r` would be
referencing memory that was deallocated when `x` went out of scope, and
anything we tried to do with `r` wouldn’t work correctly. So, how does Rust
determine that this code is invalid? It uses a borrow checker.

### The Borrow Checker

The Rust compiler has a _borrow checker_ that compares scopes to determine
whether all borrows are valid. Listing 10-17 shows the same code as Listing
10-16 but with annotations showing the lifetimes of the variables.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let r;                // ---------+-- 'a
                              //          |
        {                     //          |
            let x = 5;        // -+-- 'b  |
            r = &x;           //  |       |
        }                     // -+       |
                              //          |
        println!("r: {r}");   //          |
    }                         // ---------+

Listing 10-17: Annotations of the lifetimes of `r` and `x`, named `'a` and
`'b`, respectively

Here, we’ve annotated the lifetime of `r` with `'a` and the lifetime of `x`
with `'b`. As you can see, the inner `'b` block is much smaller than the outer
`'a` lifetime block. At compile time, Rust compares the size of the two
lifetimes and sees that `r` has a lifetime of `'a` but that it refers to
memory with a lifetime of `'b`. The program is rejected because `'b` is
shorter than `'a`: The subject of the reference doesn’t live as long as the
reference.

Listing 10-18 fixes the code so that it doesn’t have a dangling reference and
it compiles without any errors.

    
    
    fn main() {
        let x = 5;            // ----------+-- 'b
                              //           |
        let r = &x;           // --+-- 'a  |
                              //   |       |
        println!("r: {r}");   //   |       |
                              // --+       |
    }                         // ----------+

Listing 10-18: A valid reference because the data has a longer lifetime than
the reference

Here, `x` has the lifetime `'b`, which in this case is larger than `'a`. This
means `r` can reference `x` because Rust knows that the reference in `r` will
always be valid while `x` is valid.

Now that you know where the lifetimes of references are and how Rust analyzes
lifetimes to ensure that references will always be valid, let’s explore
generic lifetimes in function parameters and return values.

### Generic Lifetimes in Functions

We’ll write a function that returns the longer of two string slices. This
function will take two string slices and return a single string slice. After
we’ve implemented the `longest` function, the code in Listing 10-19 should
print `The longest string is abcd`.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let string1 = String::from("abcd");
        let string2 = "xyz";
    
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
        println!("The longest string is {result}");
    }

Listing 10-19: A `main` function that calls the `longest` function to find the
longer of two string slices

Note that we want the function to take string slices, which are references,
rather than strings, because we don’t want the `longest` function to take
ownership of its parameters. Refer to “String Slices as Parameters” in Chapter
4 for more discussion about why the parameters we use in Listing 10-19 are the
ones we want.

If we try to implement the `longest` function as shown in Listing 10-20, it
won’t compile.

Filename: src/main.rs

    
    
    fn main() {
        let string1 = String::from("abcd");
        let string2 = "xyz";
    
        let result = longest(string1.as_str(), string2);
        println!("The longest string is {result}");
    }
    
    fn longest(x: &str, y: &str) -> &str {
        if x.len() > y.len() { x } else { y }
    }

Listing 10-20: An implementation of the `longest` function that returns the
longer of two string slices but does not yet compile

Instead, we get the following error that talks about lifetimes:

    
    
    $ cargo run
       Compiling chapter10 v0.1.0 (file:///projects/chapter10)
    error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier

    For more information about this error, try `rustc --explain E0106`.
    error: could not compile `chapter10` (bin "chapter10") due to 1 previous error
    

The help text reveals that the return type needs a generic lifetime parameter
on it because Rust can’t tell whether the reference being returned refers to
`x` or `y`. Actually, we don’t know either, because the `if` block in the body
of this function returns a reference to `x` and the `else` block returns a
reference to `y`!

When we’re defining this function, we don’t know the concrete values that will
be passed into this function, so we don’t know whether the `if` case or the
`else` case will execute. We also don’t know the concrete lifetimes of the
references
